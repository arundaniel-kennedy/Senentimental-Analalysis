[an] absorbing documentary . 
whereas last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie  this equally brutal outing merely sustains it . 
first  for a movie that tries to be smart  it's kinda dumb . and second  what's with all the shooting ? 
none of his actors stand out  but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere .

the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams  even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his .

the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies . 
nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick . 
all in all  road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence . 
the journey is worth your time  especially if you have ellen pompeo sitting next to you for the ride .

frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances . . . keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease . 
the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny  and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . 
seagal ran out of movies years ago  and this is just the proof . 
workmanlike  maybe  but still a film with all the elements that made the other three great  scary times at the movies .

a small movie with a big impact . 
the fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural french school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work .

these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers . 
it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull  nerdy folks that inhabit cherish .

jackson is always watchable . 
its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious  and schneider's performance is so fine  it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again  as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
charming  if overly complicated . . . 
most fish stories are a little peculiar  but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .

at a brief 42 minutes  we need more x and less blab .

what a great way to spend 4 units of your day .
it is the sheer  selfish  wound-licking  bar-scrapping doggedness of leon's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion  despite its patchy construction . 
it has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping  reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out . 
gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic . 
mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
like mike doesn't win any points for originality . it does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style  and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism .

disney aficionados will notice distinct parallels between this story and the 1971 musical  bedknobs and broomsticks   which also dealt with british children rediscovering the power of fantasy during wartime .
the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot  but so much naturalistic small talk  delivered in almost muffled exchanges  eventually has a lulling effect . 
the success of undercover brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally . 
it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor  but neither does it exude any charm or personality . 
though the controversial korean filmmaker's latest effort is not for all tastes  it offers gorgeous imagery  effective performances  and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding . 
beneath the uncanny  inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce . . . lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments . 
a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 
the concert footage is stirring  the recording sessions are intriguing  and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers . 
cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness  not the man  and the results might drive you crazy . 
rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down . 
another one of those estrogen overdose movies like  divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood   except that the writing  acting and character development are a lot better . 
perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced  false and fabricated . 
renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance . 
funny but perilously slight . 
charming and witty  it's also somewhat clumsy . 
an animation landmark as monumental as disney's 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs .
as played by ryan gosling  danny is a frighteningly fascinating contradiction . 
yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny . 
costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops  and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
in a strange way  egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie . 
content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony  formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 
you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy's holes  and the scripters don't deserve any oscars . but the nerve-raked acting  the crackle of lines  the impressive stagings of hardware  make for some robust and scary entertainment . 
it's no lie -- big fat liar is a real charmer . 
like a tarantino movie with heart  alias betty is richly detailed  deftly executed and utterly absorbing . 
it is messy  uncouth  incomprehensible  vicious and absurd . 
light  cute and forgettable . 
mostly works because of the universal themes  earnest performances . . . and excellent use of music by india's popular gulzar and jagjit singh . 
birot's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with christophe honor� ) isn't so much bad as it is bland . 
deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence . 
sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates . 
while dutifully pulling on heartstrings  directors dean deblois and chris sanders valiantly keep punching up the mix . 
there is no substitute for on-screen chemistry  and when friel pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia  the reaction in williams is as visceral as a gut punch . 
maybe it is formula filmmaking  but there's nothing wrong with that if the film is well-crafted and this one is . 
it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor  but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . 
weighted down with slow  uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
'abandon all hope  ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide . 
often shocking but ultimately worthwhile exploration of motherhood and desperate mothers . 
the movie does its best to work us over  with second helpings of love  romance  tragedy  false dawns  real dawns  comic relief  two separate crises during marriage ceremonies  and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . 
brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
intended to be a comedy about relationships  this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area . 
needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism . 
it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun . 
as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies  signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts  which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project .
not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me  it was just a matter of 'eh . '
your taste for jonah - a veggie tales movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the holy spirit . 
it may scream low budget  but this charmer has a spirit that cannot be denied . 
should have been someone else-
campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful . 
to the film's credit  the acting is fresh and unselfconscious  and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment . 
the overall result is an intelligent  realistic portrayal of testing boundaries . 
it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything . 
everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique  which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones . 
watching spirited away is like watching an eastern imagination explode . 
the film's only missteps come from the script's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale's antics . 
it's just not very smart . 
richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings . 
falls neatly into the category of good stupid fun . 
human nature  in short  isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart . 
no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas . 
it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public . 
the story is virtually impossible to follow here  but there's a certain style and wit to the dialogue . 
the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly  squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun  and bouncy  with energetic musicals  the humor didn't quite engage this adult . 
this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew  and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
whaley's determination to immerse you in sheer  unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting . 
brian tufano's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special . 
a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie . 
gambling and throwing a basketball game for money isn't a new plot -- in fact toback himself used it in black and white . but toback's deranged immediacy makes it seem fresh again . 
it's tough  astringent  darkly funny and . . . well  it's also generic  untidy  condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning . 
impostor doesn't do much with its template  despite a remarkably strong cast . 
this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud  if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
the humor and humanity of monsoon wedding are in perfect balance . 
lightweight but appealing . 
measured against practically any like-themed film other than its oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor the silence of the lambs  red dragon rates as an exceptional thriller . 
stuffed to the brim with ideas  american instigator michael moore's film is a rambling examination of american gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition . 
 . . . brian de palma is utterly mad : cinema mad  set-piece mad  style mad . it's a beautiful madness . 
in the long  dishonorable history of quickie teen-pop exploitation  like mike stands out for its only partly synthetic decency . 
all the pieces fall together without much surprise  but little moments give it a boost . 
the inspirational screenplay by mike rich covers a lot of ground  perhaps too much  but ties things together  neatly  by the end . 
khouri manages  with terrific flair  to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum . 
an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch . 
so stupid  so ill-conceived  so badly drawn  it created whole new levels of ugly . 
the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare . 
if the last man were the last movie left on earth  there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly . 
no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer  and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .
the secrets of time travel will have been discovered  indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again . 
all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise . 
guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others don't  and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson  and  really  nobody in the viewing audience cares . 
a boring  wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater .
the movie has generic virtues  and despite a lot of involved talent  seems done by the numbers . 
 . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal . 
michael moore's latest documentary about america's thirst for violence is his best film yet . . . 
a seriocomic debut of extravagant promise by georgian-israeli director dover kosashvili . 
nothing denis has made before  like beau travil and nenette et boni  could prepare us for this gory  perverted  sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre . 
if this movie were a book  it would be a page-turner  you can't wait to see what happens next . 
bennett's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any 'reality' show  and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch some body first . 
it's good to see michael caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again . 
manages to be original  even though it rips off many of its ideas . 
occasionally  in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks  a jaded critic smacks into something truly new . 
not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed . 
if villainous vampires are your cup of blood  blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest .
with or without ballast tanks  k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low .
like vardalos and corbett  who play their roles with vibrant charm  the film  directed by joel zwick  is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can't fake . 
the very definition of what critics have come to term an  ambitious failure .  
manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state . 
there are flaws  but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we're wrapped up in the characters  how they make their choices  and why . 
features fincher's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity . 
it's not just a feel-good movie  it's a feel movie . you feel good  you feel sad  you feel pissed off  but in the end  you feel alive - which is what they did . 
a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques . 
the filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time  and in their cheap  b movie way  they succeed . 
an enchanting spectacular for potter fans anxious to ride the hogwarts express toward a new year of magic and mischief . 
 . . . a movie that  quite simply  shouldn't have been made . 
it certainly won't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time . 
all's well that ends well  and rest assured  the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags . 
it's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look . 
several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare . 
scotland looks wonderful  the fans are often funny fanatics  the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf . 
amid the shock and curiosity factors  the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 
spider-man is in the same category as x-men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average  showing signs of potential for the sequels  but not giving us much this time around . 
given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is  this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done . 
ultimately  clarity matters  both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it . 
as it stands  crocodile hunter has the hurried  badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla  which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction .
a word of advice to the makers of the singles ward : celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs . and neither do cliches  no matter how 'inside' they are . 
[janey] forgets about her other obligations  leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes  maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices  but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible . that  in itself  is extraordinary . 
it's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante's similarly styled gremlins . 
a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story  but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at . 
beneath clouds is a succinct low-budget film whose compelling characters and intelligent script are exactly what was missing from rabbit-proof fence . 
the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) . 
there is nothing outstanding about this film  but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine . 
nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations . . . 
a dreary indulgence . 
like the best of godard's movies . . . it is visually ravishing  penetrating  impenetrable . 
has an unmistakable  easy joie de vivre . 
bluer than the atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy  the movie . . . is  also  frequently hilarious . 
bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material  and he can't help throwing in a few of his own touches . 
it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . 
becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
a cutesy romantic tale with a twist . 
the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch . 
the issues are presented in such a lousy way  complete with some of the year's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments  that it's impossible to care . 
its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads . 
nothing about this movie works . 
shouldn't have been allowed to use the word  new  in its title  because there's not an original character  siuation or joke in the entire movie . 
berling and b閍rt . . . continue to impress  and isabelle huppert . . . again shows uncanny skill in getting under the skin of her characters . 
with we were soldiers  hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in . 
the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs . 
the dangerous lives of altar boys' take on adolescence feels painfully true . 
a very slow  uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
the charm of the first movie is still there  and the story feels like the logical  unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids . 
the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
 . . . less a story than an inexplicable nightmare  right down to the population's shrugging acceptance to each new horror . 
a distant  even sterile  yet compulsively watchable look at the sordid life of hogan's heroes star bob crane . 
if it's not entirely memorable  the movie is certainly easy to watch . 
it might not be 1970s animation  but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons � a retread story  bad writing  and the same old silliness .
one of the film's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret . 
unintelligible  poorly acted  brain-slappingly bad  harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic . 
the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film . 
graham greene's novel of colonialism and empire is elevated by michael caine's performance as a weary journalist in a changing world . 
in the end  the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters ?damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide . 
a forceful drama of an alienated executive who re-invents himself . 
shot in rich  shadowy black-and-white  devils chronicles  with increasingly amused irony  the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives . 
this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it's hard to know what to praise first . 
what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama . 
amazingly lame . 
i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x . 
the trick when watching godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics  savor the pleasure of his sounds and images  and ponder the historical  philosophical  and ethical issues that intersect with them . 
 . . . does such a fine job of engulfing you in its world and allying you with its characters' choices  good and ill  that its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought . 
the movie is . . . very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes . 
too damn weird to pass up  and for the blacklight crowd  way cheaper ( and better ) than pink floyd tickets . 
its vision of that awkward age when sex threatens to overwhelm everything else is acute enough to make everyone who has been there squirm with recognition . 
the piano teacher is not an easy film . it forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves  and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling . 
'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa  pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y  por momentos  deplorable . '
a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects  hoary dialogue  fluxing accents  and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks .
sch黷te's dramatic snapshot of the artist three days before his death offers an interesting bit of speculation as to the issues brecht faced as his life drew to a close . 
i highly recommend irwin  but not in the way this film showcases him . 
you may be captivated  as i was  by its moods  and by its subtly transformed star  and still wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear . 
damon brings the proper conviction to his role as [jason bourne] . 
this often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal . 
tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to  including the condition of art . 
the production has been made with an enormous amount of affection  so we believe these characters love each other . 
bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
alan and his fellow survivors are idiosyncratic enough to lift the movie above its playwriting 101 premise .
a treat for its depiction on not giving up on dreams when you're a struggling nobody . 
for every cheesy scene  though  there is a really cool bit -- the movie's conception of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions  is visually smart  cleverly written  and nicely realized . 
 . . . really horrible drek . 
mostly  shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint  or a sense of humor . 
aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai  but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . 
there's no point of view  no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight  so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity . 
it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past . 
with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids  there's not enough intelligence  wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd . 
the son's room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos . 
the photographer's show-don't-tell stance is admirable  but it can make him a problematic documentary subject . 
as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie  'lovely ! brilliant ! '
a good thriller . 
exploits [headbanger] stereotypes in good fun  while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter . 
the concept behind kung pow : enter the fist is hilarious . it's too bad nothing else is . 
 . . . a true delight . 
 . . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism . 
the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 
more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat . 
a mild  reluctant  thumbs down . 
miyazaki's nonstop images are so stunning  and his imagination so vivid  that the only possible complaint you could have about spirited away is that there is no rest period  no timeout . 
it's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction . 
 . . little action  almost no suspense or believable tension  one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
a well-put-together piece of urban satire . 
perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . 
performances are potent  and the women's stories are ably intercut and involving . 
i don't feel the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served  even if it's a dish that's best served cold . 
the film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work . 
instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral  schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view . 
a beautifully tooled action thriller about love and terrorism in korea . 
a film of ideas and wry comic mayhem . 
like these russo guys lookin' for their mamet instead found their sturges . 
by and large this is mr . kilmer's movie  and it's his strongest performance since the doors . 
it's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak . but what spectacular sizzle it is ! . . . in this incarnation its fizz is infectious . 
a witty  whimsical feature debut . 
succeeds only because bullock and grant were made to share the silver screen . 
a good music documentary  probably one of the best since the last waltz . 
the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york . 
as conceived by mr . schaeffer  christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell . 
secretary  is owned by its costars  spader and gyllenhaal . maggie g . makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and eats up the screen . 
it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess  piss on trees  b . s . one another and put on a show in drag . 
what the movie lacks in action it more than makes up for in drama  suspense  revenge  and romance . 
ruh-roh ! romething's really wrong with this ricture ! 
the performances of the children  untrained in acting  have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart . 
choppy  overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . '
if the man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness  it is also elevated by it--the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you're one of the lucky few who sought it out . 
one of the smarter offerings the horror genre has produced in recent memory  even if it's far tamer than advertised . 
there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie  but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them . 
everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
[reno] delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion . 
if s&m seems like a strange route to true love  maybe it is  but it's to this film's ( and its makers' ) credit that we believe that that's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves . 
i don't even care that there's no plot in this antonio banderas-lucy liu faceoff . it's still terrible ! 
the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 
though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism  heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors .
first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue  and the characters sound like real people . 
is office work really as alienating as 'bartleby' so effectively makes it ? 
the action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the star wars series . 
a true pleasure . 
it's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances  from himself and from newcomer derek luke . 
a touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by michel piccoli . 
partway through watching this saccharine  easter-egg-colored concoction  you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show . 
this is a stunning film  a one-of-a-kind tour de force . 
it is depressing  ruthlessly pained and depraved  the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 
ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences  but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness . 
forgettable  if good-hearted  movie . 
a fast paced and suspenseful argentinian thriller about the shadow side of play . 
the plot is straight off the shelf  the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy . 
the film is really not so much bad as bland . 
lauren ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters  this is a coming-of-age story with a twist . 
in an effort  i suspect  not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted  it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it  the piano teacher is anything but fun . 
another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing  moldering pile of  well  extreme stunt pictures . 
the film just might turn on many people to opera  in general  an art form at once visceral and spiritual  wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life . 
it's a loathsome movie  it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . 
grainy photography mars an otherwise delightful comedy of errors . 
an epic of grandeur and scale that's been decades gone from the popcorn pushing sound stages of hollywood . 
a tremendous piece of work . 
to call the other side of heaven  appalling  would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be . 
as action-adventure  this space-based homage to robert louis stevenson's treasure island fires on all plasma conduits . 
parris' performance is credible and remarkably mature . 
it's bright  pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime . 
it excels because  unlike so many other hollywood movies of its ilk  it offers hope . 
the best thing i can say about this film is that i can't wait to see what the director does next . 
ramsay  as in ratcatcher  remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid . 
eastwood winces  clutches his chest and gasps for breath . it's a spectacular performance - ahem  we hope it's only acting . 
it's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions . 
a joyous occasion
haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived  unmotivated  and psychologically unpersuasive  with an inconclusive ending . 
like a fish that's lived too long  austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 
admirable  certainly  but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only . 
this film looks like it was produced in 1954  shelved for 48 years  and repackaged for a 2002 audience .
mana gives us compelling  damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt . 
the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy  life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial . 
a french film with a more down-home flavor . 
lawrence preaches strictly to the converted . 
the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side . 
schneidermeister . . . makin' a fool of himself . . . losin' his fan base . . . 
the screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a  dungeons and dragons  fantasy with modern military weaponry . . . 
but this is lohman's film . her performance moves between heartbreak and rebellion as she continually tries to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks . 
the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john . 
trivial where it should be profound  and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .

it'll keep you wide awake and . . . very tense . 
a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us . 
it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script  but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . 
witty  vibrant  and intelligent . 
it may not be a huge cut of above the rest  but i enjoyed barbershop . it's a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters . 
evokes a palpable sense of disconnection  made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones . 
the overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of  7th heaven .
ratliff's two previous titles  plutonium circus and purgatory county show his penchant for wry  contentious configurations  and this film is part of that delicate canon . 
the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? 
ice age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ? 
very stupid and annoying . 
this may be dover kosashvili's feature directing debut  but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty  awkward and ironic . 
the spaniel-eyed jean reno infuses hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool  wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart . 
take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets . 
rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
amazingly dopey . 
 . . . while dark water isn't a complete wash ( no pun intended )  watched side-by-side with ringu  it ultimately comes off as a pale successor . 
although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor  the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke . 
despite its raucous intent  xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral  it's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy . 
confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from king hunk . 
there isn't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 
you could say that it's slow at times  you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people wouldn't  but one thing you couldn't say is that alias betty is predictable . 
barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
terminally bland  painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie  shot on digital videotape rather than film  is frequently indecipherable . 
for its 100 minutes running time  you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .
phoned-in business as usual . 
although estela bravo's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of cuban leader fidel castro  it's still a guilty pleasure to watch . 
a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics . 
the viewer takes great pleasure in watching the resourceful molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers . 
serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and  perhaps unwittingly  relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
when not wallowing in its characters' frustrations  the movie is busy contriving false  sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems . 
the actors are appealing  but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental . 
what begins as a film in the tradition of the graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant . 
grenier is terrific  bringing an unforced  rapid-fire delivery to toback's heidegger- and nietzsche-referencing dialogue . 
a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
a complex psychological drama about a father who returns to his son's home after decades away . 
colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you  burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory .
the film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people . 
this is a third-person story now  told by hollywood  and much more ordinary for it . 
an impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent . 
a fascinating but choppy documentary . 
it should be interesting  it should be poignant  it turns out to be affected and boring . 
though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director  this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit  with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
humor in i spy is so anemic . 
with or without the sex  a wonderful tale of love and destiny  told well by a master storyteller
both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes . 
mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet . 
even if you don't know the band or the album's songs by heart  you will enjoy seeing how both evolve  and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st century .
blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star  but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation . 
an opportunity missed . 
what would jesus do if he was a film director ? he'd create a movie better than this . 
a pale xerox of other  better crime movies . 
a charming but slight comedy . 
nettelbeck has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavours and emotions  one part romance novel  one part recipe book . 
this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here )  but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one can't help but think he'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art . 
instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence . 
as a director  paxton is surprisingly brilliant  deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip . 
a lean  deftly shot  well-acted  weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures .
the film doesn't sustain its initial promise with a jarring  new-agey tone creeping into the second half
there's nothing remotely topical or sexy here . 
i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
so vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt . 
with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller  new best friend   who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills . 
everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 
sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . 
if you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you . 
the powder blues and sun-splashed whites of tunis make an alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in belly-dancing clubs . 
though excessively tiresome  the uncertainty principle  as verbally pretentious as the title may be  has its handful of redeeming features  as long as you discount its ability to bore . 
well  it does go on forever . 
`martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying  i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
special p . o . v . camera mounts on bikes  skateboards  and motorcycles provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense imax screen . 
better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine . 
inconsequential road-and-buddy pic . 
the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . 
has a plot full of twists upon knots . . . and a nonstop parade of mock-tarantino scuzbag types that starts out clever but veers into overkill . 
well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons . 
the cameo-packed  m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything .
the usual movie rah-rah  pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard . 
as a kind of colorful  dramatized pbs program  frida gets the job done . but  for that  why not watch a documentary ? 
by no means a great movie  but it is a refreshingly forthright one . 
a thoughtful movie  a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one's actions . 
rather quickly  the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation . 
so few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler . 
it has the right approach and the right opening premise  but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 
call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie  but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid . 
you might not want to hang out with samantha  but you'll probably see a bit of yourself in her unfinished story . 
bond-inspired ? certainly . likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ? let's hope not . 
the movie has a soft  percolating magic  a deadpan suspense . 
the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly� alas  santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 
adults  other than the parents . . . will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild . 
director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through . 
piccoli gives a superb performance full of deep feeling . 
sure  it's contrived and predictable  but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly  even though it's never as solid as you want it to be . 
it's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs  but westbrook's foundation and dalrymple's film earn their uplift . 
so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie . 
oops  she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . 
confusion is one of my least favourite emotions  especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it .
a touching  small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community . 
whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary . 
still rapturous after all these years  cinema paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love . 
the pianist is polanski's best film . 
leigh's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher's ruinous legacy  he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other . 
the fourth in a series that i'll bet most parents had thought --hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished . 
in other words  it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus  like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 
returning director rob minkoff . . . and screenwriter bruce joel rubin . . . have done a fine job of updating white's dry wit to a new age . 
astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent  incoherent or just plain crap . indeed  none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 
. . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock .
limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very  very slowly . 
suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative . still  as a visual treat  the film is almost unsurpassed . 
seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable  the director's experiment is a successful one . 
somewhere in the middle  the film compels  as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems  but the field of roughage dominates . 
a quiet  disquieting triumph . 
the film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments  archival footage  talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime . 
as a film director  labute continues to improve . 
there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging  life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture . 
its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar  but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and  at the same time  is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time . 
the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure . 
without resorting to camp or parody  haynes ( like sirk  but differently ) has transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative  rich  and strange . 
an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode .
many of benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice . 
like its bizarre heroine  it irrigates our souls . 
its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes  which fly by so fast there's no time to think about them anyway . 
the crime matters less than the characters  although the filmmakers supply enough complications  close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us . 
proves mainly that south korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their hollywood counterparts . 
puts to rest any thought that the german film industry cannot make a delightful comedy centering on food . 
forget the misleading title  what's with the unexplained baboon cameo ? 
ozpetek offers an aids subtext  skims over the realities of gay sex  and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight  middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves . 
the work of an artist tormented by his heritage  using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims . 
i'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled  but  for those with at least a minimal appreciation of woolf and clarissa dalloway  the hours represents two of those well spent . 
his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma  rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
diggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film . 
the film is like sitting in a downtown caf�  overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing  and desperately wishing you could change tables . 
as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool  you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up . 
this cuddly sequel to the 1999 hit is a little more visually polished  a little funnier  and a little more madcap .
a charming and funny story of clashing cultures and a clashing mother/daughter relationship . 
it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best  it will never hold a candle to the original . 
it's obviously struck a responsive chord with many south koreans  and should work its magic in other parts of the world . 
like its parade of predecessors  this halloween is a gory slash-fest . it can't escape its past  and it doesn't want to . 
the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships . 
a worthwhile way to spend two hours . 
 . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . 
the film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations  nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style . 
 . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
a knowing look at female friendship  spiked with raw urban humor . 
here's a british flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility  yet just as determined to entertain you . 
new best friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video .
the camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format  before swooping down on a string of exotic locales  scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm . 
the 3d images only enhance the film's otherworldly quality  giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen .
dark and disturbing  but also surprisingly funny . 
[a] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment . 
ambitious  unsettling psychodrama that takes full  chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges  low-budget constraints . 
an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening . 
epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star . 
at 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth .
this tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change  but the song remains the same . 
director peter kosminsky gives these women a forum to demonstrate their acting 'chops' and they take full advantage . 
if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes  then you'll enjoy the hot chick . 
dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting  and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 
mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness . 
generates an enormous feeling of empathy for its characters . 
holden caulfield did it better . 
it uses an old-time formula  it's not terribly original and it's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big  dumb  happy movie my big fat greek wedding . 
despite the authenticity of the trappings  the film is overblown in its plotting  hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style . 
puportedly  based on true events   a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is  based on a true story  with a straight face . 
a high-spirited buddy movie about the reunion of berlin anarchists who face arrest 15 years after their crime .
if i have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story ( like  say  treasure planet ) or so-so animation and an exciting  clever story with a batch of appealing characters  i'll take the latter every time . 
what happened with pluto nash ? how did it ever get made ? 
has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson  however entertainingly presented  so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
hard  endearing  caring  warm . bring tissues . 
goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy  seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage . 
a few hours after you've seen it  you forget you've been to the movies . 
[lawrence bounces] all over the stage  dancing  running  sweating  mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place . 
a film in a class with spike lee's masterful do the right thing . 
a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible  plot mechanics be damned . 
every note rings false . 
on its own staggeringly unoriginal terms  this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny . 
meyjes . . . has done his homework and soaked up some jazzy new revisionist theories about the origins of nazi politics and aesthetics . 
scherfig's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky . 
a confident  richly acted  emotionally devastating piece of work and 2002's first great film
it never fails to engage us . 
surprisingly insightful
on top of a foundering performance  [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
mendes still doesn't quite know how to fill a frame . like the hanks character  he's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed . 
nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! ) into scrooge . 
elvira fans could hardly ask for more . 
the characters are complex and quirky  but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life . 
it works well enough  since the thrills pop up frequently  and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory . 
a dashing and absorbing outing with one of france's most inventive directors . 
see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned  you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died .
the unique niche of self-critical  behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality . 
yet another weepy southern bore-athon . 
even though many of these guys are less than adorable ( their lamentations are pretty much self-centered )  there's something vital about the movie . 
how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood . it's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects  but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones . 
its compelling mix of trial movie  escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy . 
a small gem from belgium . 
no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild . 
a fascinating literary mystery story with multiple strands about the controversy of who really wrote shakespeare's plays . 
has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act . 
each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature  but in its current incarnation  storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup  delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
the first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it's actually watchable . even more baffling is that it's funny . 
leguizamo and jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb . 
its gentle  touching story creeps into your heart . 
according to the script  grant and bullock's characters are made for each other . but you'd never guess that from the performances . 
while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car  bitch  ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
all movie long  city by the sea swings from one approach to the other  but in the end  it stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro  mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast . 
like the chelsea's denizens . . . burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste . 
the problem is not that it's all derivative  because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
it's fun  but the code-talk will fly right over everyone's head
statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british . 
a modestly made but profoundly moving documentary . 
the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions  but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing . 
it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through  will encourage others to stand up and applaud  and will  undoubtedly  leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come . 
the film will appeal to discovery channel fans and will surely widen the perspective of those of us who see the continent through rose-colored glasses . 
stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness  wit or any other kind of intelligent humor . 
tells ( the story ) with such atmospheric ballast that shrugging off the plot's persnickety problems is simply a matter of ( being ) in a shrugging mood . 
one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking . 
instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western  it's an unpretentious  sociologically pointed slice of life . 
halloween : resurrection isn't exactly quality cinema  but it isn't nearly as terrible as it cold have been . 
13 conversations may be a bit too enigmatic and overly ambitious to be fully successful  but sprecher and her screenwriting partner and sister  karen sprecher  don't seem ever to run out of ideas .
satisfyingly scarifying  fresh and old-fashioned at the same time . 
the impulses that produced this project . . . are commendable  but the results are uneven . 
 . . . manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun . 
i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women . 
as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph  as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming . 
the universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in 'baran . '
once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue  all credibility flies out the window . 
it's fitfully funny but never really takes off . 
  mr . deeds  is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought . 
the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy kids . 
watching haneke's film is  aptly enough  a challenge and a punishment . but watching huppert  a great actress tearing into a landmark role  is riveting . 
brown's saga  like many before his  makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie . 
it's a good film -- not a classic  but odd  entertaining and authentic . 
an entertaining documentary that freshly considers arguments the bard's immortal plays were written by somebody else . 
a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being . 
holm . . . embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma . 
the film is small in scope  yet perfectly formed . 
just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety  it dives into soapy bathos . 
the movie is genial but never inspired  and little about it will stay with you . 
although based on a real-life person  john  in the movie  is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours . 
kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night matthew was killed . 
a timid  soggy near miss . 
the bourne identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups . 
overall  it's a pretty mediocre family film . 
there's none of the happily-ever -after spangle of monsoon wedding in late marriage -- and that's part of what makes dover kosashvili's outstanding feature debut so potent . 
left me with the visceral sensation of longing  lasting traces of charlotte's web of desire and desperation . 
sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers  and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece . 
third time's the charm . . . yeah  baby ! 
give shapiro  goldman  and bolado credit for good intentions  but there's nothing here that they couldn't have done in half an hour . 
is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? 
 . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
the stars may be college kids  but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed  overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . 
an unremarkable  modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title . 
painful to watch  but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances . 
little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick . 
it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment . 
it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba  murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van . 
blue crush is as predictable as the tides . . . . the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies . 
meant to reduce blake's philosophy into a tragic coming-of-age saga punctuated by bursts of animator todd mcfarlane's superhero dystopia . 
sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing  teeth-gnashing actorliness . 
sweet home alabama is one dumb movie  but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end . 
the best of the pierce brosnan james bond films to date . 
never having seen the first two films in the series  i can't compare friday after next to them  but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days . 
a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk . 
the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 
the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy . 
just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs  but certainly no thrills . 
the film is . . . determined to treat its characters  weak and strong  as fallible human beings  not caricatures  and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation . 
by turns fanciful  grisly and engagingly quixotic . 
suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 .
a movie that at its best doesn't just make the most out of its characters' flaws but insists on the virtue of imperfection . 
at its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers . 
writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but  when he veers into sodden melodrama  punctuated by violins  it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable . 
for all its impressive craftsmanship  and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos  lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
it's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them  but olympia  wash .  based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it's what makes their project so interesting . 
the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence  complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence  but not a drop of human blood .
a broad  melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull  pretentious version of jesus' son  they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd  there's little to be learned from watching 'comedian'
has no reason to exist  other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents . 
if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich )  it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and clich� . 
it's weird  wonderful  and not necessarily for kids . 
a new film from bill plympton  the animation master  is always welcome . 
children may not understand everything that happens -- i'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated  and undoubtedly delighted . 
totally overwrought  deeply biased  and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
a deft  delightful mix of sulky teen drama and overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph . 
jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot  but even he is overwhelmed by predictability . 
by the end  i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious . 
metaphors abound  but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story . 
the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
 . . . has its moments  but ultimately  its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 
more of a career curio than a major work . 
benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted  its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 
it's a movie -- and an album -- you won't want to miss . 
diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
too often  the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance . 
 . . . the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats . 
peter jackson and company once again dazzle and delight us  fulfilling practically every expectation either a longtime tolkien fan or a movie-going neophyte could want . 
the characters are based on stock clich�s  and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility . 
[russell] makes good b movies ( the mask  the blob )  and the scorpion king more than ably meets those standards . 
even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers  old schoolers and current innovators  scratch is great fun  full of the kind of energy it's documenting . 
payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process  but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . 
in the end  tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do  too little time to do it in . 
williams plays sy  another of his open-faced  smiling madmen  like the killer in insomnia . he does this so well you don't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role . 
highly engaging . 
call me a wimp  but i cried  not once  but three times in this animated sweet film . 
watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park  you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .
ultimately the  yes  snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary  like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok . 
[l]ame and unnecessary . 
this orange has some juice  but it's far from fresh-squeezed . 
every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying  isn't it ? 
a funny  triumphant  and moving documentary . 
very well made  but doesn't generate a lot of tension . 
the year's happiest surprise  a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way . 
has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children's home video  a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment  as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting .
it all adds up to good fun . 
while certain cues  like the happy music  suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts  jeong-hyang lee's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness . 
cuba gooding jr . valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs  but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy . 
starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary  humorless soap opera . 
a polished and vastly entertaining caper film that puts the sting back into the con . 
it's good  hard-edged stuff  violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done  morally alert and street-smart . 
although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar  every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn  to grow  to travel . 
ms . phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma  and is unable to project either esther's initial anomie or her eventual awakening . 
what's surprising about this traditional thriller  moderately successful but not completely satisfying  is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be . 
it's not thirsty  consuming passion which drives this movie . no  it's the repetition of said behavior  and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad  more grating and boring than anything else . 
i stopped thinking about how good it all was  and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations  thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled  feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness  gasping at its visual delights . 
i can't say that i liked homeboy ; it'd be more accurate to say that i found it intriguing  bizarre  dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful  in its way . 
absurdities and clich�s accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel . 
likeable thanks to its cast  its cuisine and its quirky tunes . 
time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets
alternately hilarious and sad  aggravating and soulful  scathing and joyous . it's a masterpeice . 
when twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives  hard-driving narcissism is a given  but what a world we'd live in if argento's hollywood counterparts . . . had this much imagination and nerve . 
the best comedy concert movie i've seen since cho's previous concert comedy film  i'm the one that i want  in 2000 .
as happily glib and vicious as its characters . 
apuestas fuertes para el futuro del director  y apuestas bien fundadas  pues la suerte ya la tiene  y la cinta lo comprueba . . . . 
lohman adapts to the changes required of her  but the actress and director peter kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects
although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage  it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film . 
the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation . . . . stylistically  the movie is a disaster . 
burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . 
it's supposed to be a humorous  all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 
glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum . 
it will grip even viewers who aren't interested in rap  as it cuts to the heart of american society in an unnerving way . 
the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield .
 . . . plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller . 
missteps take what was otherwise a fascinating  riveting story and send it down the path of the mundane . 
a nearly 21/2 hours  the film is way too indulgent .
more whiny downer than corruscating commentary . 
 . . . a triumph of emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking . 
deadeningly dull  mired in convoluted melodrama  nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness . 
my own minority report is that it stinks . 
moonlight mile gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things . it is sentimental but feels free to offend  is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters  is about grief and yet permits laughter . 
at its best  which occurs often  michael moore's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking  soul-searching spirit of the 'are we a sick society ? ' journalism of the 1960s .
filled with honest performances and exceptional detail  baran is a gentle film with dramatic punch  a haunting ode to humanity . 
  punch-drunk love  is a little like a chocolate milk moustache . . . 
never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and  along the way  expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds . 
if only merchant paid more attention the story . 
this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted . 
the message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles  whether they be of nature  of man or of one another . 
it's harmless  diverting fluff . but it's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre . 
two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity . 
it's no accident that the accidental spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form . 
don't let your festive spirit go this far . 
�it wasn't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film�it was the unfulfilling  incongruous   wait a second  did i miss something ?  ending . 
when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science  it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
chai's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 
woody allen's latest is an ambling  broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz . 
be patient with the lovely hush ! and your reward will be a thoughtful  emotional movie experience . 
moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured . 
an unusually dry-eyed  even analytical approach to material that is generally played for maximum moisture . 
best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein's life would do better elsewhere . 
bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . 
ultimately  the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks  if you're up for that sort of thing . 
even if you're an agnostic carnivore  you can enjoy much of jonah simply  and gratefully  as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor . 
fulfills the minimum requirement of disney animation . 
a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise . 
ultimate x is a ride  basically the kind of greatest-hits reel that might come with a subscription to espn the magazine . 
like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop  comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
smug  artificial  ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite  degenerating into a pious  preachy soap opera . 
all in all  a great party . 
as lo-fi as the special effects are  the folks who cobbled nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that george lucas has long forgotten . 
[the film] tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward  emotionally honest manner that by the end  it's impossible to ascertain whether the film is  at its core  deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful . 
one of the year's best films  featuring an oscar-worthy performance by julianne moore . 
this insightful  oscar-nominated documentary  in which children on both sides of the ever-escalating conflict have their say away from watchful parental eyes  gives peace yet another chance . 
hip-hop has a history  and it's a metaphor for this love story . 
the director explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of truffaut . 
it is amusing  and that's all it needs to be . 
renner ? s face is chillingly unemotive  yet he communicates a great deal in his performance . see it for his performance if nothing else . 
you emerge dazed  confused as to whether you've seen pornography or documentary . 
an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes . 
louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode  and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense . 
funny and also heartwarming without stooping to gooeyness . 
needless to say  the dramatics that follow are utter hooey . 
the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing  but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies . 
you come away wishing  though  that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story . 
a compelling  moving film that respects its audience and its source material . 
it's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time . 
although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure  it feels more forced than usual . 
this isn't a terrible film by any means  but it's also far from being a realized work . 
it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative )  but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year . 
 . . . a quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job . . . 
in any case  i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995's forget paris . but even then  i'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes .
a gem of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever  amusing and unpredictable . 
focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her  madness  so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device .
when compared to the usual  more somber festival entries  davis' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart  smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic . 
all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie  but it's spread too thin . 
your response to its new sequel  analyze that  may hinge on what you thought of the first film . 
an enigmatic film that's too clever for its own good  it's a conundrum not worth solving . 
starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus  point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages  over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar . 
 . . . spiced with humor ( 'i speak fluent flatula  ' advises denlopp after a rather  er  bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand ) and witty updatings ( silver's parrot has been replaced with morph  a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around ) 
it's a pedestrian  flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . 
dolgin and franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a vietnamese-born youngster who eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-american girl with a brand new name in southern tennessee . 
consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is . 
it's a drawling  slobbering  lovable run-on sentence of a film  a southern gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack . 
if you value your time and money  find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite  predictable rehash . 
less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice belgian waffle . 
tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here . 
a whole lot foul  freaky and funny . 
just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny . 
an unbelievably stupid film  though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity . 
the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long  trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war  revolution  communism  etc . 
insanely hilarious ! i haven't laughed that hard in years ! 
feels slight  as if it were an extended short  albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . 
what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey  experimental entertainment . still  i'm not quite sure what the point is?rich in detail  gorgeously shot and beautifully acted  les destinees is  in its quiet  epic way  daring  inventive and refreshingly unusual . 
a gorgeous  witty  seductive movie . 
though not for everyone  the guys is a somber trip worth taking . 
well-meaning to a fault  antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy . 
sayles . . . once again strands his superb performers in the same old story . 
noyce creates a film of near-hypnotic physical beauty even as he tells a story as horrifying as any in the heart-breakingly extensive annals of white-on-black racism . 
nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley's breasts -- is authentic . 
this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite . 
oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material
ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas  but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them  forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
a highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle  and by the end  we only wish we could have spent more time in its world . 
legendary irish writer brendan behan's memoir  borstal boy  has been given a loving screen transferral . 
keenly observed and refreshingly natural  swimming gets the details right  from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach  s . c .  to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner . 
a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises  read my lips is an original . this is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone  but together they are magnificent . 
the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years .
meyjes' provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil . 
an engrossing portrait of uncompromising artists trying to create something original against the backdrop of a corporate music industry that only seems to care about the bottom line . 
 ( a ) hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning . . . ( but ) lohman's moist  deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer . . . 
majidi's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser  if a bit draggy at times . 
apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 
serving sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it . 
dramatically lackluster . 
made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
enormously likable  partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd . 
unspeakable  of course  barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
'the ch�teau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
jacquot's rendering of puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera . in his first stab at the form  jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically . 
oscar wilde's masterpiece  the importance of being earnest  may be the best play of the 19th century . it's so good that its relentless  polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions  but even oliver parker's movie adaptation .
a tired  unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre . 
every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
maryam is a small film  but it offers large rewards . 
[while the last metro] was more melodramatic  confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions  while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history . 
if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure  one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't . 
two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama . 
'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination  i mean  alabama . '
the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling . they just don't work in concert . 
a vivid  sometimes surreal  glimpse into the mysteries of human behavior . 
like a soft drink that's been sitting open too long : it's too much syrup and not enough fizz . 
the chateau . . . is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters . 
the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue  just because it seems obligatory . 
nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose  poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
a depraved  incoherent  instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
candid camera on methamphetamines . 
the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre  funny  tragic - like love in new york ) . 
while it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting  brisk delight .
made to be jaglomized is the cannes film festival  the annual riviera spree of flesh  buzz  blab and money . the charming result is festival in cannes . 
the mood  look and tone of the film fit the incredible storyline to a t . 
now i can see why people thought i was too hard on  the mothman prophecies  . 
it wouldn't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe's routine is offensive  puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 
shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady  ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever  a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives . 
shiner can certainly go the distance  but isn't world championship material
kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 
a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place  but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
too long  and larded with exposition  this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community . 
a rarity among recent iranian films : it's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist's plight . 
some people march to the beat of a different drum  and if you ever wondered what kind of houses those people live in  this documentary takes a look at 5 alternative housing options .

  the turntable is now outselling the electric guitar . . .  
in theory  a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising  but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .

a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad  soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
stupid  infantile  redundant  sloppy  over-the-top  and amateurish . yep  it's  waking up in reno .  go back to sleep . 
a diverse and astonishingly articulate cast of palestinian and israeli children . 
even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash .

it's sweet  harmless  dumb  occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show . 
becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters . 
turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film's characters
cold  sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
inventive  fun  intoxicatingly sexy  violent  self-indulgent and maddening .

all three actresses are simply dazzling  particularly balk  who's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents . 
it has the charm of the original american road movies  feasting on the gorgeous  ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker's motherland . 
they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
at a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons  it's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is  and knows the form's history . 
 . . . a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off . 
i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin' down . 
occasionally loud and offensive  but more often  it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma . 
filled with low-brow humor  gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life . 
what lee does so marvelously compelling is present brown as a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america . . . sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown  a celebrated wonder in the spotlight
  on guard !  won't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world's best actors  daniel auteuil  have a whale of a good time . 
demonstrates a vivid imagination and an impressive style that result in some terrific setpieces . 
elegant and eloquent [meditation] on death and that most elusive of passions  love . 
more tiring than anything . 
a little weak -- and it isn't that funny .

disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material . 
not once does it come close to being exciting . 
this harrowing journey into combat hell vividly captures the chaotic insanity and personal tragedies that are all too abundant when human hatred spews forth unchecked . 
a spellbinding african film about the modern condition of rootlessness  a state experienced by millions around the globe .

full of surprises . 
any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script  though with the same number of continuity errors . 
wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy  but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
it remains to be seen whether statham can move beyond the crime-land action genre  but then again  who says he has to ? 
how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us  the answer is clear : not easily and  in the end  not well enough . 
a great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family .

dull  lifeless  and amateurishly assembled . 
a marvel like none you've seen . 
one of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself  namely  an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then .

a standard police-oriented drama that  were it not for de niro's participation  would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big  colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way .

the comedy makes social commentary more palatable . 
the best film of the year 2002 .
the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence . 
effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience . 
what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
like any good romance  son of the bride  proves it's never too late to learn . 
a well-acted  but one-note film . 
not a strike against yang's similarly themed yi yi  but i found what time ? to be more engaging on an emotional level  funnier  and on the whole less detached . 
roger michell  who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england  gets too artsy in his american debut . 
a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance . . . 
good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there's a plethora of characters in this picture  and not one of them is flat . 
it's a decent glimpse into a time period  and an outcast  that is no longer accessible  but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor . 
hoffman's performance is authentic to the core of his being . 
munch's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters . he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities . his scenes are short and often unexpected . 
[taymor] utilizes the idea of making kahlo's art a living  breathing part of the movie  often catapulting the artist into her own work . this isn't a new idea . it's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion . 
goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures  and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 
most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and  no matter how broomfield dresses it up  it tends to speculation  conspiracy theories or  at best  circumstantial evidence . 
a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange . the fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point . 
clare peploe's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence . 
quiet  adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year . . . a true study  a film with a questioning heart and mind that isn't afraid to admit it doesn't have all the answers . 
the acting  costumes  music  cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production's austere locales . 
all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull . 
a love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection  scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats . 
admirably ambitious but self-indulgent . 
like all of egoyan's work  ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious . 
blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . 
robinson's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that clancy creates . 
an ambitious movie that  like shiner's organizing of the big fight  pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that don't come off . 
the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected . 
the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters . 
but tongue-in-cheek preposterousness has always been part of for the most part wilde's droll whimsy helps  being earnest  overcome its weaknesses and parker's creative interference . . . 
 . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy  so uneven  so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer  young or old  would have a good time here . 
nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it  from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute  haphazard theatrical release . 
few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury  and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as nesbitt's cooper looks when the bullets stop flying . 
the movie gets muted and routine . 
the movie is pretty funny now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects . 
children and adults enamored of all things pokemon won't be disappointed .

completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
sharp  lively  funny and ultimately sobering film . 
 . . . manages to fall closer in quality to silence than to the abysmal hannibal . 
'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half  but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel  nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 
not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks  college flicks  or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward . 
banal and predictable . 
a film neither bitter nor sweet  neither romantic nor comedic  neither warm nor fuzzy . 
as written by michael berg and michael j . wilson from a story by wilson  this relentless  all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all . 
swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell . 
a little objectivity could have gone a long way . 
audacious-impossible yet compelling . . . 
although tender and touching  the movie would have benefited from a little more dramatic tension and some more editing .

the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity . 
it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 
robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
murderous maids may well be the most comprehensive of these films and also strike closest to the truth . 
the best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like  but how the creative process itself operates . 
the picture runs a mere 84 minutes  but it's no glance . it's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written  beautifully read and  finally  deeply humanizing .
tailored to entertain ! 
snoots will no doubt rally to its cause  trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey  but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this . 
the picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life  but also acknowledging the places  and the people  from whence you came . 
disjointed parody . 
an elegant and sly deadpan comedy . 
i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . 
it is an indelible epic american story about two families  one black and one white  facing change in both their inner and outer lives . 
the film's highlight is definitely its screenplay  both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page  and for the memorable character creations . 
feardotcom's thrills are all cheap  but they mostly work . 
follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor  verve and fun . 
innocuous enough to make even jean-claude van damme look good . 
the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither . 
stay clear of reminding yourself that it's a  true story  and you're likely to have one helluva time at the movies . 
it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
director carl franklin  so crisp and economical in one false move  bogs down in genre cliches here . 
cattaneo should have followed the runaway success of his first film  the full monty  with something different . 
you don't have to know about music to appreciate the film's easygoing blend of comedy and romance . 
makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil . 
time out is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term . 
it jumps around with little logic or continuity  presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular  anciently demanding m�tier . 
remains a solid  if somewhat heavy-handed  account of the near-disaster . . . done up by howard with a steady  if not very imaginative  hand . 
shunji iwai's all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot  but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan . 
plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on  the simpsons  has . 
it should be doing a lot of things  but doesn't . 
though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors  jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set . 
charming and funny ( but ultimately silly ) movie . 
the jokes are sophomoric  stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . 
an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen  unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood . 
just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham  lots of cheese  with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite . 
i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . 
this is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies . 
the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high  even as the strafings blend together . 
the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder . 
occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going . 
the salton sea has moments of inspired humour  though every scrap is of the darkest variety . 
[gulpilil] is a commanding screen presence  and his character's abundant humanism makes him the film's moral compass . 
bubba ho-tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by bruce campbell that doesn't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it . 
so brisk is wang's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe . 
it's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure . 
we get some truly unique character studies and a cross-section of americana that hollywood couldn't possibly fictionalize and be believed . 
a densely constructed  highly referential film  and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among jean-luc godard's finest work . 
dull and mechanical  kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
a vivid  spicy footnote to history  and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish . 
this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films  but it's a compelling story  mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there . 
for all its violence  the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression . 
hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make  nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build  to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world . 
a subtle  poignant picture of goodness that is flawed  compromised and sad . 
a mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last . 
is red dragon worthy of a place alongside the other hannibal movies ? as hannibal would say  yes  'it's like having an old friend for dinner' . 
an action/thriller of the finest kind  evoking memories of day of the jackal  the french connection  and heat . 
nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite : friends will be friends through thick and thin . 
 . . . too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be . 
although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse  the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching . 
don't even bother to rent this on video . 
most consumers of lo mein and general tso's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it  so  hopefully  this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons . 
painful  horrifying and oppressively tragic  this film should not be missed . 
the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise  mr . desplechin is content to state it . 
a masterpiece four years in the making . 
time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool  clockstoppers   but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .
melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back . 
strange it is  but delightfully so . 
a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed  but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater . 
with exquisite craftsmanship . . . olivier assayas has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois french society . 
windtalkers blows this way and that  but there's no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass  true to himself . 
a pleasant  if forgettable  romp of a film .

soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film . what's left is a rich stew of longing .
when the movie mixes the cornpone and the cosa nostra  it finds a nice rhythm . 
lasker's canny  meditative script distances sex and love  as byron and luther . . . realize they can't get no satisfaction without the latter . 
the result  however well-intentioned  is ironically just the sort of disposable  kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 
less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling ( though no less horrifying for it ) . 
self-congratulatory  misguided  and ill-informed  if nonetheless compulsively watchable . 
whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable . 
although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television  music and stand-up comedy  this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless �70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .
count on his movie to work at the back of your neck long after you leave the theater . 
there is a welcome lack of pretension about the film  which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure . 
creepy  authentic and dark . this disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget . 
show me the mugging . 
jacquot's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances . . . while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself . 
in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people  the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk  with little to show for their labor  living harmoniously  joined in song . 
sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard . 
the video work is so grainy and rough  so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up  that it's exhausting to watch . 
director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure  and this is a better film than his earlier english-language movie  the overpraised elizabeth . 
cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .
you wonder why enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie . 
below is well below expectations . 
japanese director shohei imamura's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime . 
ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting  personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum . 
it would be interesting to hear from the other side  but in talk to her  the women are down for the count . 
the story has its redundancies  and the young actors  not very experienced  are sometimes inexpressive . 
a sly dissection of the inanities of the contemporary music business and a rather sad story of the difficulties of artistic collaboration . 
stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed . 
daring  mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget . 
i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
an eloquent  reflective and beautifully acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow  painful healing process that has followed in their wake . 
the movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times  give you a few laughs  and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks  even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end . 
the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie's hideous yellow 'do . 
not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring  at times sublime  visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the x into the games . 
the picture  scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination  is a monument to bad in all its florid variety . 
for decades we've marveled at disney's rendering of water  snow  flames and shadows in a hand-drawn animated world . prepare to marvel again . 
the special effects and many scenes of weightlessness look as good or better than in the original  while the oscar-winning sound and james horner's rousing score make good use of the hefty audio system . 
a rip-roaring comedy action fest that'll put hairs on your chest . 
it is bad  but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
incoherence reigns . 
earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
 . . . there are enough moments of heartbreaking honesty to keep one glued to the screen . 
 . . . pitiful  slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one . 
safe conduct  however ambitious and well-intentioned  fails to hit the entertainment bull's-eye . 
an amusing and unexpectedly insightful examination of sexual jealousy  resentment and the fine line between passion and pretence . 
a captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners . 
ana is a vivid  vibrant individual and the movie's focus upon her makes it successful and accessible . 
doug liman  the director of bourne  directs the traffic well  gets a nice wintry look from his locations  absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses damon's ability to be focused and sincere . 
a quiet treasure -- a film to be savored . 
a knowing sense of humor and a lot of warmth ignite son of the bride . 
the overall fabric is hypnotic  and mr . mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy . 
an even more predictable  cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
as if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges  kathryn bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness . her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant . 
everything about girls can't swim  even its passages of sensitive observation  feels secondhand  familiar -- and not in a good way . 
yes they can swim  the title is merely anne-sophie birot's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through . 
eccentric enough to stave off doldrums  caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable . 
much monkeyfun for all . 
a poignant lyricism runs through balzac and the little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem . 
the movie takes itself too seriously and  as a result  it makes for only intermittent fun . 
a thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it doesn't follow the stale  standard  connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world . 
a baffling misfire  and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years . 
definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category  reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable . 
ultimately   mib ii  succeeds due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it can't be dismissed as mindless . 
pure of intention and passably diverting  his secret life is light  innocuous and unremarkable . 
at times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . yet in its own aloof  unreachable way it's so fascinating you won't be able to look away for a second . 
it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
broder's screenplay is shallow  offensive and redundant  with pitifully few real laughs . 
plot  characters  drama  emotions  ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
you don't know whether to admire the film's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace . or both . 
director hoffman  his writer and kline's agent should serve detention
in the spirit of the season  i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it . 
the film is a blunt indictment  part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity . 
moody  heartbreaking  and filmed in a natural  unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not . 
even by dumb action-movie standards  ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie . 
the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second  despite the best efforts of everyone involved . 
a memorable experience that  like many of his works  presents weighty issues colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill . 
like a pack of dynamite sticks  built for controversy . the film is explosive  but a few of those sticks are wet . 
it's easy to love robin tunney -- she's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices . 
about as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life . 
van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table  but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats  freddy got fingered  and slackers . 
a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material . 
to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
a cultural wildcard experience : wacky  different  unusual  even nutty . 
rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along . 
what makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people  in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship  bring to their music . 
the closest thing to the experience of space travel
it's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure  as long as you don't try to look too deep into the story
a decidedly mixed bag . 
[cho's face is] an amazing slapstick instrument  creating a scrapbook of living mug shots . 
chicago is  in many ways  an admirable achievement . 
mr . polanski is in his element here : alone  abandoned  but still consoled by his art  which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival . 
i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games  of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
one of the best looking and stylish animated movies in quite a while . . . 
it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie  directed by scott kalvert  about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches  gratuitous violence  or empty machismo .
one scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce . 
with dickens' words and writer-director douglas mcgrath's even-toned direction  a ripping good yarn is told . 
pete's screenplay manages to find that real natural  even-flowing tone that few movies are able to accomplish . 
as teen movies go   orange county  is a refreshing change
shamelessly sappy and  worse  runs away from its own provocative theme . 
the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of . 
a perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey comedy . 
shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens  obsessive relationships  and rampant adultery so dull . 
if you want a movie time trip  the 1960 version is a far smoother ride .
you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing . 
a beautifully observed character piece . 
trite  banal  cliched  mostly inoffensive . 
it throws quirky characters  odd situations  and off-kilter dialogue at us  all as if to say   look at this ! this is an interesting movie !  but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging . 
a working class  us vs . them  opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered . 
ferrara's strongest and most touching movie of recent years . 
huppert gives erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her  trying to understand her and wondering if she'll crack . 
essentially an exceptionally well-written  well-edited  well-directed  well-acted  bald rip-off of aliens . 
talky  artificial and opaque . . . an interesting technical exercise  but a tedious picture . 
there's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot  and cq shimmers with it .
tense  terrific  sweaty-palmed fun . 
it's splash without the jokes . 
exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza . 
velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film'' as a commodified  sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene . 
mr . deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple  sweet and romantic comedy . 
the directing and story are disjointed  flaws that have to be laid squarely on taylor's doorstep . but the actors make this worth a peek . 
the marquis de sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be . 
those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one . 
if you've ever wondered what an ending without the input of studio executives or test audiences would look like  here it is . 
it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over  but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
'yes  that's right : it's forrest gump  angel of death . '
the premise is in extremely bad taste  and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them . 
whatever complaints i might have  i'd take [its] earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor's club any time . 
it's hard to imagine anybody ever being  in the mood  to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone  but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started . 
a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
most new movies have a bright sheen . some  like ballistic  arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten  well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future . 
possession is in the end an honorable  interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry  but it's not bad prose . 
despite a powerful portrayal by binoche  it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum . 
a terrific date movie  whatever your orientation . 
it provides the grand  intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot . 
by the time we learn that andrew's turnabout is fair play is every bit as awful as borchardt's coven  we can enjoy it anyway . 
traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clich�s that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill . 
i am sorry that i was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy . 
'the film is stark  straightforward and deadly . . . an unnatural calm that's occasionally shaken by . . . blasts of rage  and later  violent jealousy . '
bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher  when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made . 
let's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home . 
a very long movie  dull in stretches  with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction . 
visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying . 
equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama . 
the acting by the over-25s lacks spark  with csokas particularly unconnected .
this odd  poetic road movie  spiked by jolts of pop music  pretty much takes place in morton's ever-watchful gaze -- and it's a tribute to the actress  and to her inventive director  that the journey is such a mesmerizing one . 
ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power  even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic  dysfunctional and destructive . 
i think it was plato who said  'i think  therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character  we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .
using an endearing cast  writer/director dover kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships  both sexual and kindred . 
the aaa of action  xxx is a blast of adrenalin  rated eee for excitement . and vin diesel is the man . 
a modest masterpiece . 
to my taste  the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
a fine production with splendid singing by angela gheorghiu  ruggero raimondi  and roberto alagna . 
kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against  for that matter ) . 
'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that  if it were a person  you'd want to smash its face in . '
a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction  when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 
the film didn't move me one way or the other  but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due . 
over-the-top and a bit ostentatious  this is a movie that's got oodles of style and substance . 
highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it . 
what saves this deeply affecting film from being merely a collection of wrenching cases is corcuera's attention to detail . 
it's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force . 
if you love reading and/or poetry  then by all means check it out . you'll probably love it . 
i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material  but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort . 
a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy  old-fashioned entertainment out of it . 
'anyone with a passion for cinema  and indeed sex  should see it as soon as possible . '
binoche and magimel are perfect in these roles . 
for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island  or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic  this one feels like an impostor .
thirty years ago  it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired . 
dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 
there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 
a worthwhile documentary  whether you're into rap or not  even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll . 
ultimately  it ponders the reasons we need stories so much . 
first good  then bothersome . excellent acting and direction . 
it's a thin notion  repetitively stretched out to feature length  awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects  droning house music and flat  flat dialogue . 
it sounds sick and twisted  but the miracle of shainberg's film is that it truly is romance
a movie of riveting power and sadness . 
[javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film  which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama . 
this is simply the most fun you'll ever have with a documentary ! 
the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts . 
the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love  lust  and sin couldn't keep my attention . 
we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 
once again  director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours . 
this is so bad . 
the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen . 
a dream cast of solid female talent who build a seamless ensemble . there isn't a weak or careless performance amongst them . 
at the end of the movie  my 6-year-old nephew said   i guess i come from a broken family  and my uncles are all aliens  too .  congrats disney on a job well done  i enjoyed it just as much !
on the surface  it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick  but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work  films like the double life of veronique . 
the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch . 
poor editing  bad bluescreen  and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . 
an elegant work  food of love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing . 
exciting and direct  with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes . 
too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient . 
an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series  accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags  pranks  pratfalls  dares  injuries  etc . 
this movie got me grinning . there's a part of us that cannot help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something . 
[ramsay] visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art  music and metaphor . 
looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination . 
nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray  and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
the film's intimate camera work and searing performances pull us deep into the girls' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that's opened between them . 
you're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous . 
the movie is well crafted  and well executed . if you're paying attention  the  big twists  are pretty easy to guess - but that doesn't make the movie any less entertaining . 
the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments . 
 . . . just a big mess of a movie  full of images and events  but no tension or surprise . 
a piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness . 
darkly funny and frequently insightful . 
robin williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man in favour of an altogether darker side . 
once [kim] begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors  you may decide it's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard . 
the sword fighting is well done and auteuil is a goofy pleasure . 
you watch for that sense of openness  the little surprises . 
the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous  the acting is robotically italicized  and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
as befits its title  this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear .
it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie . 
consummate actor barry has done excellent work here . 
an impressive hybrid . 
it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic  the wife is patient  the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate  but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 
both shrill and soporific  and because everything is repeated five or six times  it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
this 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than i'd expected it to be .
the ending feels at odds with the rest of the film . 
even murphy's expert comic timing and famed charisma can't rescue this effort . 
more timely than its director could ever have dreamed  this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders  desperate for work and food . 
proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie . 
there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
a tired  predictable  bordering on offensive  waste of time  money and celluloid . 
it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred  puts a human face on it  evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding . 
the story really has no place to go since simone is not real�she can't provide any conflict . 
no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina . 
it plays like a big-budget  after-school special with a generous cast  who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness . 
the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
matthew mcconaughey tries  and fails  to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy . 
a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes .
what [denis] accomplishes in his chilling  unnerving film is a double portrait of two young women whose lives were as claustrophic  suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned . 
at times funny and at other times candidly revealing  it's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do . 
[h]ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang  i'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by . 
a triumph of pure craft and passionate heart . 
trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the  gadzooks !  
it's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak  and it has been unearthed and released now  when it has become even weaker .
the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate/surf culture  the l . a . beach scene and the imaginative ( and sometimes illegal ) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults . 
devos delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower . 
we haven't seen such hilarity since say it isn't so ! 
i won't argue with anyone who calls 'slackers' dumb  insulting  or childish . . . but i laughed so much that i didn't mind . 
while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line )  the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity . 
good car chases  great fight scenes  and a distinctive blend of european  american and asian influences . 
never inspires more than an interested detachment . 
fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot ! 
an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal . 
depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen  then laughs at how clever it's being . 
it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness  and where human nature should be ingratiating  it's just grating . 
one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou . 
despite its hawaiian setting  the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick  the basic plot of  lilo  could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage shirley temple script . 
it may not be as cutting  as witty or as true as back in the glory days of weekend and two or three things i know about her  but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ? 
if it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original  then sl2 does just that .
this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998's whatever .
ozpetek's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie . 
scherfig  the writer-director  has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar . yes  soar . 
it's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our hollywood has all but lost . 
to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting  to say the least  not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife . 
ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying  like swallowing a communion wafer without the wine . 
despite all evidence to the contrary  this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie  the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
[sports] admirable energy  full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency . 
mr . clooney  mr . kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster . 
little more than a frothy vanity project . 
k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension .
what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 
for a film about explosions and death and spies   ballistic : ecks vs . sever  seems as safe as a children's film . well  in some of those  the mother deer even dies . 
this is a story that zings all the way through with originality  humour and pathos . 
manages to accomplish what few sequels can -- it equals the original and in some ways even betters it . 
much of what we see is horrible but it's also undeniably exceedingly clever . 
it's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery  but otherwise this is the best 'old neighborhood' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists . 
predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell . 
the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays . 
the hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational  and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment . 
for a film about two mismatched buddies  crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry . 
a blair witch- style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera  with passable performances from everyone in the cast . 
  men in black ii   has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant  the jokes are a little lukewarm  but will anyone really care ? 
affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into  a role that ford effortlessly filled with authority . 
waydowntown is by no means a perfect film  but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality . 
this isn't a narrative film -- i don't know if it's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th  though i'm sure some will try -- but it's as close as anyone has dared to come .
unfolds in a low-key  organic way that encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow . 
foster and whitaker are especially fine . she is a lioness  protecting her cub  and he a reluctant villain  incapable of controlling his crew . 
desta vez  columbus capturou o pomo de ouro . 
a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards  'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary . 
the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative . 
this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people . 
grating and tedious . 
[drumline] is entertaining for what it does  and admirable for what it doesn't do . 
[there's] quite a bit of heart  as you would expect from the directors of the little mermaid and aladdin . 
the film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet . 
charlotte sometimes is a gem . it's always enthralling . 
director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama . 
by the time it ends in a rush of sequins  flashbulbs  blaring brass and back-stabbing babes  it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better . 
i just loved every minute of this film . 
we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together  and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest . 
if you thought tom hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star  wait until you've seen him eight stories tall . 
thoroughly engrossing and ultimately tragic . 
the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
it's also curious to note that this film  like the similarly ill-timed antitrust  is easily as bad at a fraction the budget . 
[allen's] been making piffle for a long while  and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . 
formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor .
you'll end up moved . 
so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises
throughout  mr . audiard's direction is fluid and quick . 
its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world's remarkably varying human population and mindset  and its capacity to heal using creative  natural and ancient antidotes . 
'charly' will divide its audience in two separate groups  those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy . . . 
a hideous  confusing spectacle  one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations . 
it's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before . 
a boring  formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash . 
a markedly inactive film  city is conversational bordering on confessional . 
more maudlin than sharp . 
it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation  from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media . . . to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks . 
complete lack of originality  cleverness or even visible effort
 . . . hokey art house pretension . 
makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes  becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
if this is cinema  i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey . 
filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved  this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water . 
not about scares but a mood in which an ominous  pervasive  and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense . 
all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto . 
the heat of the moment prevails . it cooks conduct in a low  smoky and inviting sizzle .

the more you think about the movie  the more you will probably like it . 
you really have to salute writer-director haneke ( he adapted elfriede jelinek's novel ) for making a film that isn't nearly as graphic but much more powerful  brutally shocking and difficult to watch .

zhuangzhuang creates delicate balance of style  text  and subtext that's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance  but against all odds  nothing does . 
the observations of this social/economic/urban environment are canny and spiced with irony . 
showtime is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation . 
a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers . 
worse than 'silence of the lambs' better than 'hannibal'
it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
it's got all the familiar bruckheimer elements  and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas . 
proves a servicable world war ii drama that can't totally hide its contrivances  but it at least calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored . 
more trifle than triumph . 
sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss  and that's more or less how it plays out . 
perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
sometimes this 'blood' seems as tired as its protagonist . . . still  the pulse never disappears entirely  and the picture crosses the finish line winded but still game . 
collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .
there are a couple of things that elevate  glory  above most of its ilk  most notably the mere presence of duvall . 
one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
soderbergh  like kubrick before him  may not touch the planet's skin  but understands the workings of its spirit . 
it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches . 
i found the ring moderately absorbing  largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound . 
extremely well acted by the four primary actors  this is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten . 
the chateau belongs to rudd  whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting french malapropisms . . . is a nonstop hoot . 
i got a headache watching this meaningless downer . 
the film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political blair witch  a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen . 
altogether  this is successful as a film  while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece . 
i'd rather watch a rerun of the powerpuff girls
this film is full of rabbits . brimful . but like most rabbits  it seems to lack substance . 
the gorgeously elaborate continuation of  the lord of the rings  trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe co-writer/director peter jackson's expanded vision of j . r . r . tolkien's middle-earth . 
after an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly  sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be  you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be . 
there's a neat twist  subtly rendered  that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes  but kang tacks on three or four more endings .
this movie is maddening . it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought . 
an instance of an old dog not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick . 
oedekerk wrote patch adams  for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote  directed  starred and produced -- is beyond me . 
this movie may not have the highest production values you've ever seen  but it's the work of an artist  one whose view of america  history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep . 
somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever  though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes . 
the saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence  and the quiet american brings us right into the center of that world .
daring and beautifully made . 
in addition to hoffman's powerful acting clinic  this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt  or will feel someday . 
the warnings to resist temptation in this film . . . are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean . 
sade is an engaging look at the controversial eponymous and fiercely atheistic hero . 
though in some ways similar to catherine breillat's fat girl  rain is the far superior film . 
directed with purpose and finesse by england's roger mitchell  who handily makes the move from pleasing  relatively lightweight commercial fare such as notting hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft . 
love liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit . 
with an admirably dark first script by brent hanley  paxton  making his directorial feature debut  does strong  measured work . 
with a completely predictable plot  you'll swear that you've seen it all before  even if you've never come within a mile of the longest yard . 
it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake  dishonest  entertaining and  ultimately  more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary . 
b閍rt and berling are both superb  while huppert . . . is magnificent . 
despite its sincere acting  signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying . 
if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices  you're interested in anne geddes  john grisham  and thomas kincaid . 
an encouraging effort from mccrudden
plodding  peevish and gimmicky . 
the magic ( and original running time ) of ace japanimator hayao miyazaki's spirited away survives intact in bv's re-voiced version . 
. . . an agreeable time-wasting device -- but george pal's low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs .
 . . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex  outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs . 
romantic comedy and dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows  but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here .
[an] hilarious romantic comedy . 
it's the kind of under-inspired  overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name . 
her fans walked out muttering words like  horrible  and  terrible   but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero . 
a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy . 
without september 11  collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad  embarrassing movie .
it just may inspire a few younger moviegoers to read stevenson's book  which is a treasure in and of itself . 
well-meant but unoriginal . 
if you're content with a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director's life  eisenstein delivers . 
what eric schaeffer has accomplished with never again may not  strictly speaking  qualify as revolutionary . but it's defiantly and delightfully against the grain . 
they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans . 
in death to smoochy  we don't get williams' usual tear and a smile  just sneers and bile  and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing .

[e]ventually  every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism . 
texan director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings  and he delivers fascinating psychological fare .

the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20  000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .

if not a home run  then at least a solid base hit . 
spielberg's realization of a near-future america is masterful . this makes minority report necessary viewing for sci-fi fans  as the film has some of the best special effects ever .

there's the plot  and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . 
we have poignancy jostling against farce  thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners  and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except  maybe  that it looks neat . 
chicago offers much colorful eye candy  including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes  hoofing and crooning with the best of them . 
a real movie  about real people  that gives us a rare glimpse into a culture most of us don't know . 
 . . . instead go rent  shakes the clown   a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance .

eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema's directorial giants . 
the venezuelans say things like  si  pretty much  and  por favor  go home  when talking to americans . that's muy loco  but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of  dragonfly .

a lousy movie that's not merely unwatchable  but also unlistenable . 
a incompet�ncia de marcus adams como roteirista s� � superada por sua p�ssima dire��o . 
portentous and pretentious  the weight of water is appropriately titled  given the heavy-handedness of it drama . 
cold  nervy and memorable .

bravo for history rewritten  and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love . 
the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others' affections .

campanella's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael's evolution . 
the pianist [is] a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we  today  can prevent its tragic waste of life . here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life  his dignity and his music .

this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time .

nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you . he makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty . 
so-so entertainment .

the film has a terrific look and salma hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life . 
it's a glorified sitcom  and a long  unfunny one at that . 
equilibrium is what george orwell might have imagined had today's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 .
both lead performances are oscar-size . quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie  and moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver .

i know i shouldn't have laughed  but hey  those farts got to my inner nine-year-old . 
this is so de palma . if you love him  you'll like it . if you don't . . . well  skip to another review .

the vintage is pure '87  with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one .
for all the dolorous trim  secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout  notwithstanding some of the writers' sporadic dips into pop freudianism .

the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long . 
this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .

surprisingly  the film is a hilarious adventure and i shamelessly enjoyed it . 
nicole holofcener's lovely and amazing  from her own screenplay  jumps to the head of the class of women's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style . 
a thoroughly awful movie--dumb  narratively chaotic  visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '

an original gem about an obsession with time . 
mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about  or is ill-equipped to examine  the interior lives of the characters in his film  much less incorporate them into his narrative . 
it's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness  and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing .

a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight  and indicative of his  if you will  out-of-kilter character  who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . 
the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes  and their interaction is numbingly predictable .

to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable . 
there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew . 
卆n eerily suspenseful  deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller . 
white hasn't developed characters so much as caricatures  one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else .

this is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that doesn't reveal even a hint of artifice . 
it won't bust your gut -- and it's not intended to -- it's merely a blandly cinematic surgical examination of what makes a joke a joke . 
this piece of channel 5 grade trash is  quite frankly  an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .

forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention  giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays . 
. . . will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks . after seeing the film  i can tell you that there's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .
if this is the danish idea of a good time  prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war  perhaps . 
a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore . 
aside from being the funniest movie of the year  simone  andrew niccol's brilliant anti-hollywood satire  has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it . 
the script ? please . 
acting  particularly by tambor  almost makes  never again  worthwhile  but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
aptly named  this shimmering  beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me . 
the direction has a fluid  no-nonsense authority  and the performances by harris  phifer and cam'ron seal the deal . 
a lovely film for the holiday season . 
a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian  though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up  this has to be among the rare ones . 
nothing more than a mediocre trifle . 
just plain silly . 
more precious than perspicacious
like showgirls and glitter  the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
a journey through memory  a celebration of living  and a sobering rumination on fatality  classism  and ignorance .

the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland .
[a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . .

after the setup  the air leaks out of the movie  flattening its momentum with about an hour to go . 
the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal . 
it's a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told  with superb performances throughout . 
stevenson's performance is at once clueless and fiercely committed  a volatile combination . 
romantic  riveting and handsomely animated . 
mr . deeds is  as comedy goes  very silly -- and in the best way . 
it's funny  touching  dramatically forceful  and beautifully shot . 
300 years of russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent  seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness .
a bracing  unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale . 
the result is good gossip  entertainingly delivered  yet with a distinctly musty odour  its expiry date long gone . 
the story is also as unoriginal as they come  already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count . 
full of witless jokes  dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios  and saddled with a general air of misogyny

if you believe any of this  i can make you a real deal on leftover enron stock that will double in value a week from friday . 
sorority boys  which is as bad at it is cruel  takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it . 
the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies .
once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand  even the funniest idea isn't funny . 
first and foremost . . . the reason to go see  blue crush  is the phenomenal  water-born cinematography by david hennings . 
unsurprisingly  the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers  instead of serious athletes . 
exactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos . 
a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally . 
an emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema . 
the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well . 
 . . . the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes  what time is it there ?  something the true film buff will enjoy . 
overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial  ( it's ) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring . 
charlotte sometimes is a brilliant movie . it is about irrational  unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity . 
what's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that's tv sitcom material at best . 
it lets you brush up against the humanity of a psycho  without making him any less psycho . 
a wonderful  ghastly film . 
anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going . 
no big whoop  nothing new to see  zero thrills  too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film .

terminally brain dead production . 
a cockeyed shot all the way . 
if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body  a rumor of angels should dispel it . 
the sort of picture in which  whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do  they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 
an earnest  heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views . 
though few will argue that it ranks with the best of herzog's works  invincible shows he's back in form  with an astoundingly rich film . 
if the material is slight and admittedly manipulative  jacquot preserves tosca's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera . 
all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders  but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject . 
the kind of movie that comes along only occasionally  one so unconventional  gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away . 
the all-french cast is marveilleux . 
a movie that will thrill you  touch you and make you laugh as well . 
loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes  twitchy acting  and general boorishness .

criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama . 
lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks  but not anyone else . 
even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog  and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .

lan yu is at times too restrained  yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most american love stories look downright unfree . 
it's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days  seven nights  maybe  or that dreadful sabrina remake . 
the film starts promisingly  but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work . 
the story is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution . 
writer-director's mehta's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture  the intoxicating masala  of cultures and film genres . 
a gem  captured in the unhurried  low-key style favored by many directors of the iranian new wave . 
the filmmaker's heart is in the right place . . . 
heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations . 
a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services .

flotsam in the sea of moviemaking  not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising . 
even through its flaws  revolution #9 proves to be a compelling  interestingly told film .
christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists  who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
blue crush is so prolonged and boring it isn't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be . 
stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time . 
it's a tour de force  written and directed so quietly that it's implosion rather than explosion you fear . 
it's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant . 
the search for redemption makes for a touching love story  mainly because blanchett and ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters' suffering . 
an extremely unpleasant film . 
does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 
scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism . 
what time is it there ? is not easy . it haunts you  you can't forget it  you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it . 
all mood and no movie . 
mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values . 
several uninteresting  unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in  unfaithful .  why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me . 
a sweet-natured reconsideration of one of san francisco's most vital  if least widely recognized  creative fountainheads . 
it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity  [yet] are worthwhile . 
it's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit . 
an average coming-of-age tale elevated by the wholesome twist of a pesky mother interfering during her son's discovery of his homosexuality . 
a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers . 
without a strong script and energetic acting  dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos . 
�its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself . 
the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long  you're desperate for the evening to end .
will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest  most deceptively amusing comedies of the year . 
manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting . 
the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
friday after next is the kind of film that could only be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans . 
if you don't flee  you might be seduced . if you don't laugh  flee . 
a powerful  inflammatory film about religion that dares to question an ancient faith  and about hatred that offers no easy  comfortable resolution . 
every time you look  sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn . 
changing lanes is an anomaly for a hollywood movie ; it's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say . 
if your taste runs to 'difficult' films you absolutely can't miss it . 
it's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive . 
don't wait to see this terrific film with your kids -- if you don't have kids borrow some . 
shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character  is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic . 
seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago .
�a big  baggy  sprawling carnival of a movie  stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason . 
i'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business  but surely it doesn't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks . 
makes the case for a strong education and good teachers being more valuable in the way they help increase an average student's self-esteem  and not strictly in the knowledge imparted . 
presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it . 
director douglas mcgrath takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading .
a giddy and provocative sexual romp that has something to say . 
the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence . 
the mothman prophecies  which is mostly a bore  seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . 
the film's final hour  where nearly all the previous unseen material resides  is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
it's a beautiful film  full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it's also pretty funny . 
the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects � from the tv movie-esque  affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed . 
if you're a wwf fan  or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i .  you'll probably like rollerball . 
it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .
generic thriller junk . teens only . 
an intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality . 
a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless  lifeless  meandering  loud  painful  obnoxious . 
it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing  let alone funny . 
if you really want to understand what this story is really all about  you're far better served by the source material . 
for this sort of thing to work  we need agile performers  but the proficient  dull sorvino has no light touch  and rodan is out of his league . 
may not be a breakthrough in filmmaking  but it is unwavering and arresting . 
an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it isn't . 
certainly the performances are worthwhile . 
a strong first act and absolutely  inescapably gorgeous  skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing spider-man . 
my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional . 
birthday girl is an amusing joy ride  with some surprisingly violent moments . 
to call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement  and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest . 
truly terrible . 
opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen . 
dreary  highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
pure cinematic intoxication  a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama  tastelessness and swooning elegance . 
a warm  funny  engaging film . 
too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining . 
cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success . . . but neglects to add the magic that made it all work . 
nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection  several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . 
despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life  it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . 
playfully profound . . . and crazier than michael jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows . 
while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah  patriotic tone  soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 
on the whole  the movie lacks wit  feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality . 
with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on  chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . 
wasabi is slight fare indeed  with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches )  but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn . 
demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake  but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh . 
perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy  hope and despair  about schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness . 
the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
this engrossing  characteristically complex tom clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time . 
there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending . 
the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
as allen's execution date closes in  the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator david presson . 
the central story lacks punch . 
an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and  worse  that you have to pay if you want to see it .
it's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up  a terrific climax  and some nice chills along the way . 
the filmmaker ascends  literally  to the olympus of the art world  but he would have done well to end this flawed  dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
collateral damage is trash  but it earns extra points by acting as if it weren't . 
it is great summer fun to watch arnold and his buddy gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters . 
the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another  most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
there's very little sense to what's going on here  but the makers serve up the cliches with considerable dash . 
austin powers for the most part is extremely funny  the first part making up for any flaws that come later . 
the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap . 
throw smoochy from the train ! 
observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom . 
it's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances  but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable . 
thurman and lewis are hilarious throughout . 
it's a smart  solid  kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn . nothing overly original  mind you  but solidly entertaining . 
enjoyably fast-moving  hard-hitting documentary . 
 . . . an otherwise intense  twist-and-turn thriller that certainly shouldn't hurt talented young gaghan's resume . 
slick piece of cross-promotion . 
a loud  witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug  but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be . 
such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise  you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 
it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times  but is just too lame to work or be cool at others . 
final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
a gentle  compassionate drama about grief and healing . 
while the plot follows a predictable connect-the-dots course . . . director john schultz colors the picture in some evocative shades . 
the unexplored story opportunities of  punch-drunk love  may have worked against the maker's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director anderson . 
exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 
boy oh boy  it's a howler . 
well-acted  well-directed and  for all its moodiness  not too pretentious . 
nicely combines the enigmatic features of 'memento' with the hallucinatory drug culture of 'requiem for a dream . '
it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead . 
there has always been something likable about the marquis de sade . 
tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar . 
the movie tries to be ethereal  but ends up seeming goofy . 
there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production . 
bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year  full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them . 
that it'll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture
splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity . 
'a' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy . 
only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for . 
there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling  but brooms isn't it . 
will anyone who isn't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video ? 
a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino . 
occasionally funny  sometimes inspiring  often boring . 
the characters . . . are paper-thin  and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try . 
it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion .
those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking .
passable entertainment  but it's the kind of motion picture that won't make much of a splash when it's released  and will not be remembered long afterwards . 
with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry's boss  there isn't a redeeming moment here . 
the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not . 
egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement  and  if you'll excuse a little critical heresy  too intellectually ambitious . 
the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it  although  in a movie about cancer  this might be apt . 
the last scenes of the film are anguished  bitter and truthful . mr . koshashvili is a director to watch . 
a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground . 
this is an extraordinary film  not least because it is japanese and yet feels universal . 
sweet home alabama  is what it is ?a nice  harmless date film . . . 
nair doesn't treat the issues lightly . she allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly . 
the film is visually dazzling  the depicted events dramatic  funny and poignant . 
hardman is a grating  mannered onscreen presence  which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny  aggressive and alive  you have to watch them because you can't wait to see what they do next . 
takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze . 
lovely and poignant . puts a human face on a land most westerners are unfamiliar with . 
if you come from a family that eats  meddles  argues  laughs  kibbitzes and fights together  then go see this delightful comedy . 
will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good  the bad and the ugly . 
one of the funniest motion pictures of the year  but . . . also one of the most curiously depressing . 
 . . . a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet . 
the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny  a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story  which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
there's a disreputable air about the whole thing  and that's what makes it irresistible . 
recalls quiet freak-outs like l'avventura and repulsion . 
a deftly entertaining film  smartly played and smartly directed . 
begins as a promising meditation on one of america's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt . 
my big fat greek wedding is that rare animal known as 'a perfect family film  ' because it's about family . 
good movie . good actress . but if you expect light romantic comedy  good gosh  will you be shocked . 
features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film . 
if mostly martha is mostly unsurprising  it's still a sweet  even delectable diversion . 
no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either . 
how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know . 
nair stuffs the film with dancing  henna  ornamentation  and group song  but her narrative clich�s and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera . 
the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about .
what makes this film special is serry's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context . 
what started out as a taut contest of wills between bacon and theron  deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence . 
despite its title  amy's orgasm is not a porno  though it is as tedious as one . 
ryan gosling is  in a word  brilliant as the conflicted daniel . 
deliberately and devotedly constructed  far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect  too neat and new pin-like  too obviously a recreation to resonate . 
one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history . 
an immensely entertaining look at some of the unsung heroes of 20th century pop music .
an enjoyable above average summer diversion . 
the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries . 
the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish . 
a penetrating  potent exploration of sanctimony  self-awareness  self-hatred and self-determination . 
fast  frantic and fun  but also soon forgotten
the real triumphs in igby come from philippe  who makes oliver far more interesting than the character's lines would suggest  and sarandon  who couldn't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron . 
represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen . 
an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating . 
a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale . 
the film is beautifully mounted  but  more to the point  the issues are subtly presented  managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan's madness . 
more than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling . 
the characters seem one-dimensional  and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .

a sly game of cat and mouse that's intense and thrilling at times  but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances .

throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth  windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
a classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached . 
viewed as a comedy  a romance  a fairy tale  or a drama  there's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture . 
when perry fists a bull at the moore farm  it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart . 
like most bond outings in recent years  some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike . a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series . 
too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good  it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing . 
an extraordinary dramatic experience . 
until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity . 
black-and-white and unrealistic . 
[chaiken's] talent lies in an evocative  accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively  convincing dialogue she creates for her characters . 
the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old  familiar vaudeville partners . 
parker holds true to wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning  and no desire to be anything but a polished  sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness . 
so many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists  but family fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality . 
davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is . 
the title not only describes its main characters  but the lazy people behind the camera as well . 
the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds  but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining . 
it made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters . i thought the relationships were wonderful  the comedy was funny  and the love 'real' . 
while [roman coppola] scores points for style  he staggers in terms of story . 
i've had more interesting -- and  dare i say  thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf  point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama . 
sadly  hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns  not making snappy comebacks . 
what's the most positive thing that can be said about the new rob schneider vehicle ? well  it's not as pathetic as the animal . 
the movie sticks much closer to hornby's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did . 
taken purely as an exercise in style  this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore . but as a movie  it's a humorless  disjointed mess . 
edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects  pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head  making it rousing  invigorating fun lacking any mtv puffery . 
it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism  dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .
watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another  you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart . 
i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history  ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible  banal dialogue ; convenient  hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull  unimaginative car chase . 
clumsy  obvious  preposterous  the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 
each scene drags  underscoring the obvious  and sentiment is slathered on top . 
the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity  originality and delight . 
a whole lot of fun and funny in the middle  though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish . 
personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives  but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 
it's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing . 
the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive . 
the tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern china in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology . 
a clever script and skilled actors bring new energy to the familiar topic of office politics . 
in its ragged  cheap and unassuming way  the movie works . 
plunges you into a reality that is  more often then not  difficult and sad  and then  without sentimentalizing it or denying its brutality  transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision . 
like those to rome  all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn's breasts  which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them . 
does point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets . 
the rare movie that's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it's based . 
a big  gorgeous  sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand  uncomplicated fashion . 
at 90 minutes this movie is short  but it feels much longer .
whether our action-and-popcorn obsessed culture will embrace this engaging and literate psychodrama isn't much of a mystery  unfortunately . 
red dragon is less baroque and showy than hannibal  and less emotionally affecting than silence . but  like silence  it's a movie that gets under your skin . 
muddled  trashy and incompetent
on its own  big trouble could be considered a funny little film . 
this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes  but it's a tad slow .
collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff  but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks  pyro-correctly . 
a fascinating and fun film . 
director rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one . 
feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and  perhaps more than he realizes  just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work . 
could this be the first major studio production shot on video tape instead of film ? 
maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts . 
despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers  the show . . . represents a spectacular piece of theater  and there's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it . 
kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 
with the film's striking ending  one realizes that we have a long way to go before we fully understand all the sexual permutations involved . 
'[the cockettes] provides a window into a subculture hell-bent on expressing itself in every way imaginable . '
the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke's artistic aspirations  but he hasn't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul . 
the performances are an absolute joy . 
the film's unhurried pace is actually one of its strengths . entirely appropriately  the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn . 
eastwood is an icon of moviemaking  one of the best actors  directors and producers around  responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it . 
ranges from laugh-out-loud hilarious to wonder-what- time-it-is tedious . 
[a] wonderfully loopy tale of love  longing  and voting . 
with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere  the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful . 
if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape  in his latest  he'd have them mate . 
an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship . 
in the director's cut  the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush  all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes . 
while the glass slipper doesn't quite fit  pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale . 
while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull  rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought  making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
if you are into splatter movies  then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese . 
as literary desecrations go  this makes for perfectly acceptable  occasionally very enjoyable children's entertainment . you'll forget about it by monday  though  and if they're old enough to have developed some taste  so will your kids . 
about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time . 
a moving and not infrequently breathtaking film . 
a relative letdown . 
not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out  but it has clearly been made with affection and care . 
if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips . 
a moody  multi-dimensional love story and sci-fi mystery  solaris is a thought-provoking  haunting film that allows the seeds of the imagination to germinate . 
a thoroughly enjoyable  heartfelt coming-of-age comedy . 
if you've grown tired of going where no man has gone before  but several movies have - take heart . this is the best star trek movie in a long time . 
davis is funny  charming and quirky in her feature film acting debut as amy . 
despite its flaws  secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions . 
tiresomely derivative and hammily acted . 
[crystal and de niro] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing . 
works because  for the most part  it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren . 
the smash 'em-up  crash 'em-up  shoot 'em-up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense . 
comes off more like a misdemeanor  a flat  unconvincing drama that never catches fire . 
sad to say -- it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people . 
one lousy movie . 
the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny  but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration . 
reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior  it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining . 
the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
i have a confession to make : i didn't particularly like e . t . the first time i saw it as a young boy . that is because - damn it ! - i also wanted a little alien as a friend ! 
for the most part stevens glides through on some solid performances and witty dialogue . 
kwan is a master of shadow  quietude  and room noise  and lan yu is a disarmingly lived-in movie . 
a gob of drivel so sickly sweet  even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid cr�me br�l�e . 
the pool drowned me in boredom . 
a loving little film of considerable appeal . 
every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid  so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy . half past dead is just such an achievement . 
did the film inform and educate me ? yes . did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 armenia ? no . and that is where ararat went astray .
despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
'estupendamente actuada  sumamente emotiva y profundamente humana  es una experiencia f韑mica imposible de olvidar'
as it stands  there's some fine sex onscreen  and some tense arguing  but not a whole lot more . 
there is a kind of attentive concern that hoffman brings to his characters  as if he has been giving them private lessons  and now it is time for their first public recital . 
this slow-moving swedish film offers not even a hint of joy  preferring to focus on the humiliation of martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party . 
pumpkin wants to have it both ways . 
for single digits kidlets stuart little 2 is still a no brainer . if you're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film  you'll need a stronger stomach than us .
sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor  and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do . 
nair's cast is so large it's altman-esque  but she deftly spins the multiple stories in a vibrant and intoxicating fashion . 
a damn fine and a truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film . 
this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career . 
due to stodgy  soap opera-ish dialogue  the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
an extraordinary swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage -- the kind of intimate and character-driven film that bille august does best . 
comedy troupe broken lizard's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot . 
you've already seen heartbreak if you've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard . even the unwatchable soapdish is more original . 
while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film  it's far from being this generation's animal house . 
a visionary marvel  but it's lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this . 
with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter  the improbable  formula 51  is somewhat entertaining  but it could have been much stronger .
 . . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids . 
it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . 
an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 
it may be an easy swipe to take  but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut . 
a thinly veiled look at different aspects of chinese life clashing with each other . 
intriguing and stylish . 
the best movie of its kind since 'brazil . ' lucas  take notes . this is how you use special effects . 
as well-acted and well-intentioned as all or nothing is  however  the film comes perilously close to being too bleak  too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good . 
much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive . 
the movie is ingenious fun . see it . 
partly a schmaltzy  by-the-numbers romantic comedy  partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 
cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes  as in the film's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark's dogma movement . 
fear permeates the whole of stortelling  todd solondz' oftentimes funny  yet ultimately cowardly autocritique . 
everyone's to blame here . 
a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns  expensive cars  lots of naked women and rocawear clothing . 
an instant candidate for worst movie of the year . 
the writing is clever and the cast is appealing . 
there's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes  plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme . 
well-made but mush-hearted . 
 . . . a joke at once flaky and resonant  lightweight and bizarrely original . 
polished korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as hollywood action epics . is this progress ? 
parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today  without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place . 
even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate . 
it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling  but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work . 
el t韙ulo no enga馻 : la pel韈ula narra una historia donde una mujer enfrentar?cierta realidad  y donde el sexo es . . . 
hugely entertaining from start to finish  featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves  it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels . 
just entertaining enough not to hate  too mediocre to love . 
one of [jaglom's] better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love . 
lends itself to the narcotizing bland ( sinister  though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie ) machinations of the biennial disney boy movie . 
not a bad premise  but the execution is lackluster at best . 
an exhilarating futuristic thriller-noir  minority report twists the best of technology around a gripping story  delivering a riveting  pulse intensifying escapist adventure of the first order
tom shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing adams  but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it . 
just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole . 
nonsensical  dull  cyber-horror  flick is a grim  hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting . 
i have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration  but i've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than i want to believe . 
davis . . . gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft ally mcbeal-style fantasy sequences . 
the next generation of mob movie . part low rent godfather . part three stooges . 
there's not much to fatale  outside of its stylish surprises . . . but that's ok . 
arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year
taken as a whole  the tuxedo doesn't add up to a whole lot . 
a wildly funny prison caper . 
for once  a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies  but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own . 
so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines . 
as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character  there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy  clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
with a confrontational stance  todd solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families . 
who is this movie for ? not kids  who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
the four feathers has rewards  from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes . 
the most brilliant and brutal uk crime film since jack carter went back to newcastle  the first half of gangster no . 1 drips with style and  at times  blood .
i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways . 
slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie  but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 
it is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters . 
works because reno doesn't become smug or sanctimonious towards the audience . 
the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama  ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged . 
[fessenden] is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills
a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification . 
purely propaganda  a work of unabashed hero worship  it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u . s . foreign policy has played in the rise of castro . 
a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast  but never quite gets off the ground . 
nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing . 
ultimately the project comes across as clinical  detached  uninvolving  possibly prompting audience members to wonder  'what's the point ? '
generally  clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler  while happily killing 94 minutes .
the plot is so amusingly contrived and outlandish in its coincidences that no one could ever mistake it for anything resembling reality
although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants  dogtown and z-boys has a compelling story to tell . 
what's surprising about full frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness  parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you . 
touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes  not least the notion that the marginal members of society . . . might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants . 
it doesn't quite deserve the gong  but there are more fascinating acts than  confessions of a dangerous mind .  
a painfully funny ode to bad behavior . 
the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes  masturbation jokes  and racist japanese jokes . 
this story of a determined woman's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments . 
julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors  sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent . 
filmmaker tian zhuangzhuang triumphantly returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power . 
the messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable  allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time . 
jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he's easy to like and always leaves us laughing . 
as the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe  the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing . 
the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film  which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say  is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
it doesn't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes . it still feels like a prison stretch .
it's a humble effort  but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos  especially between morgan and redgrave . 
worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film . 
rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories . 
despite an overwrought ending  the film works as well as it does because of the performances . 
the events of the film are just so weird that i honestly never knew what the hell was coming next . 
an uncluttered  resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations . 
sounding like arnold schwarzenegger  with a physique to match  [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
the film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience . it has fun being grown up . 
preposterous and tedious  sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that  unfortunately  occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . 
no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek  the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make . 
[at least] moore is a real charmer . 
the ya-ya's have many secrets and one is - the books are better . translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be ya-ya . 
elling builds gradually until you feel fully embraced by this gentle comedy . 
[jackson and bledel] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops  but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd . 
the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo  but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking  quietly vulnerable personality of ms . ambrose . 
the film has several strong performances . 
starts out with tremendous promise  introducing an intriguing and alluring premise  only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter . 
gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 
god is great  the movie's not . 
an energetic  violent movie with a momentum that never lets up . 
if this movie belonged to a sorority  it would be called beta alpha delta . 
not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny  they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
make no mistake  ivans xtc . is a mess . 
one of the most original american productions this year  you'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state . 
it's obvious [je-gyu is] trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom . 
divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine  but it's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya  what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances . 
it finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice . 
the stripped-down dramatic constructs  austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics  obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt . 
becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast  bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
 . . . somehow manages to escape the shackles of its own clich閟 to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks . 
it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy  but it has its moments . 
despite all the closed-door hanky-panky  the film is essentially juiceless . 
director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10  000 times .
another rent installment for the ian fleming estate . 
an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality . 
analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes  with a few new swings thrown in . 
funny and  at times  poignant  the film from director george hickenlooper all takes place in pasadena   a city where people still read .  
many insightful moments . 
despite its floating narrative  this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film . 
considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts  this must have been a difficult shoot  but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland . 
told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings . 
this is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology  either liberal or conservative . mr . scorsese's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated .

the movie is amateurish  but it's a minor treat . 
succumbs to the same kind of maudlin  sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies . 
just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . 
kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities . 
a funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a british cast to rival gosford park's . 
the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula  though  and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . 
evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story  but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
it's so badly made on every level that i'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it . 
the emperor's club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world  but . . . 
 . . . digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations .

the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor . 
predictably soulless techno-tripe .

who is the audience for cletis tout ? anybody who enjoys quirky  fun  popcorn movies with a touch of silliness and a little bloodshed . 
taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes . 
the plot has a number of holes  and at times it's simply baffling .

this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes  but feels twice as long .
a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating  boring  and forgettable . 
more a load of enjoyable  conan-esque claptrap than the punishing  special-effects soul assaults the mummy pictures represent . 
it's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys  regardless of their ages . 
offers much to enjoy . . . and a lot to mull over in terms of love  loyalty and the nature of staying friends . 
the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture . much of the way  though  this is a refreshingly novel ride . 
despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot  moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . . 
it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch  yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . 
the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time  and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix . 
ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies  and that makes for some glacial pacing early on . 
the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition .

a very capable nailbiter . 
the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry  but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight .

just isn't as weird as it ought to be .

kinnear's performance is a career-defining revelation . 
a soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes . . . almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of b-movie imagination .
diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing . 
the film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots  spy-on-the-run picture . 
one of the most incoherent features in recent memory . 
the fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier . 
each story is built on a potentially interesting idea  but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting  while the third feels limited by its short running time .

this film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent  deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion . 
perhaps it's cliche to call the film 'refreshing  ' but it is . 'drumline' shows a level of young  black manhood that is funny  touching  smart and complicated . 
director-chef gabriele muccino keeps it fast -- zippy  comin' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale .

it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline  and once the initial high wears off  the film's shortcomings start to shine through . 
this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states . 
a compelling spanish film about the withering effects of jealousy in the life of a young monarch whose sexual passion for her husband becomes an obsession .

a flawed but engrossing thriller . 
one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids  children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . 
summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this . 
rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid . . . 
what's surprising is how well it holds up in an era in which computer-generated images are the norm .

a deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish . 
spectacular in every sense of the word  even if you don' t know an orc from a uruk-hai . 
writer/director joe carnahan's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches  but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic . 
feels haphazard  as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot . 
i'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept  but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap clich� .

a provocative movie about loss  anger  greed  jealousy  sickness and love . 
the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting .

the cold turkey would've been a far better title . 
 . . . a weak  manipulative  pencil-thin story that is miraculously able to entertain anyway . 
this is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain . 
claude chabrol has here a thriller without thrills  but that's okay . 
the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .

most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears . 
hatfield and hicks make the oddest of couples  and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world  offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie's political ramifications . 
an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak  former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future  that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . . 
 . . . no charm  no laughs  no fun  no reason to watch . 
it's tough to watch  but it's a fantastic movie .

tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare  unchecked heartache of yasujiro ozu . 
a playful iranian parable about openness  particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences . 
a weird little movie that's amusing enough while you watch it  offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l . a . 's show-biz and media subcultures . but it doesn't leave you with much . 
[i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context  but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be .

the film  despite the gratuitous cinematic distractions impressed upon it  is still good fun . 
like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone . you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt  but no new friends . 
a simple  sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting  but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .

shattering  devastating documentary on two maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral . extraordinary debut from josh koury . 
if the film has a problem  its shortness disappoints : you want the story to go on and on . 
candid and comfortable ; a film that deftly balances action and reflection as it lets you grasp and feel the passion others have for their work . 
topkapi this is not . 
what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety . 
merely as a technical  logistical feat  russian ark marks a cinematic milestone .

twenty years later  e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone . 
intensely romantic  thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery . 
the film's strength isn't in its details  but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself  with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest  media-soaked fears .

there are moments of hilarity to be had .

no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives  but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh  and more entertaining  too . 
it's a smart  funny look at an arcane area of popular culture  and if it isn't entirely persuasive  it does give exposure to some talented performers . 
full of profound  real-life moments that anyone can relate to  it deserves a wide audience . 
a lame comedy . 
i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived .

the determination of pinochet's victims to seek justice  and their often heartbreaking testimony  spoken directly into director patricio guzman's camera  pack a powerful emotional wallop . 
really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length . 
an ugly  revolting movie . 
under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time .
the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
the irwins emerge unscathed  but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .

everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting .

the film never rises above a conventional  two dimension tale
adam sandler's heart may be in the right place  but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
an engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic documentary . 
the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment . 
it desperately wants to be a wacky  screwball comedy  but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
all ends well  sort of  but the frenzied comic moments never click . 
so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it . 
 . . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . 
  juwanna mann ?  no thanks . wewannour money back  actually . 
boisterous and daft documentary . 
it sticks rigidly to the paradigm  rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived  well-worn situations .

cool ? this movie is a snow emergency . 
it is a testament of quiet endurance  of common concern  of reconciled survival . 
watching these two actors play against each other so intensely  but with restraint  is a treat . 
more concerned with sade's ideas than with his actions . the movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as . . . [quills] did by showing them . 
a brutally dry satire of middle american numbness . 
a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence . 
the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year . 
a tender and touching drama  based on the true story of a troubled african-american's quest to come to terms with his origins  reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle . 
roman coppola may never become the filmmaker his dad was  but heck ?few filmmakers will . but based on cq  i'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project . 
the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition . 
there's no conversion effort  much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career  if they want one . 
a quirky comedy set in newfoundland that cleverly captures the dry wit that's so prevalent on the rock . 
a model of what films like this should be like . 
like life on the island  the movie grows boring despite the scenery . 
finally  the french-produced  read my lips  is a movie that understands characters must come first .

once folks started hanging out at the barbershop  they never wanted to leave . chances are you won't  either . 
five screenwriters are credited with the clich�-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before . 
a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable  especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . 
anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally  and log on to something more user-friendly . 
denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche  a last-second goal to win the championship  but it neglects few others .

by turns pretentious  fascinating  ludicrous  provocative and vainglorious . 
[sen's] soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions . 
it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison . 
for the most part  the film does hold up pretty well . 
the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year . 
[  take care of my cat  ] is an honestly nice little film that takes us on an examination of young adult life in urban south korea through the hearts and minds of the five principals . 
bad company leaves a bad taste  not only because of its bad-luck timing  but also the staleness of its script . 
contains the humor  characterization  poignancy  and intelligence of a bad sitcom . 
from the opening scenes  it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
being unique doesn't necessarily equate to being good  no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke . 
lead actress ga? she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile  is a towering siren . 
at times  the suspense is palpable  but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . 
a clever blend of fact and fiction . 
first-time director jo�o pedro rodrigues' unwillingness to define his hero's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on . 
an uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k . dick stories . 
scores no points for originality  wit  or intelligence . it's a cookie-cutter movie  a cut-and-paste job . 
mostly  [goldbacher] just lets her complicated characters be unruly  confusing and  through it all  human . 
a bittersweet drama about the limbo of grief and how truth-telling can open the door to liberation . 
hu and liu offer natural  matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow  longing and love . 
a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more . 
interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story . 
really quite funny . 
peppering this urban study with references to norwegian folktales  villeneuve creates in maelstrom a world where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical . 
an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 
too silly to take seriously . 
a terrifically entertaining specimen of spielbergian sci-fi . 
'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo  manipulative sentimentality  and sappy dialogue . 
an intriguing cinematic omnibus and round-robin that occasionally is more interesting in concept than in execution . 
bean drops the ball too many times . . . hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay . 
an intimate  good-humored ethnic comedy like numerous others but cuts deeper than expected . 
where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story  which provided an engrossing dramatic through line  here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners  poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
aggravating and tedious . 
the year's greatest adventure  and jackson's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate . 
despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title  writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 
tadpole is a sophisticated  funny and good-natured treat  slight but a pleasure . 
bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake . 
horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan  madonna doesn't suck as an actress . 
outer-space buffs might love this film  but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled . 
by not averting his eyes  solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable  the unacceptable  the unmentionable . 
only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives  still with the boiler suit and white mask  which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .
for its seriousness  high literary aspirations and stunning acting  the film can only be applauded . 
smith's approach is never to tease  except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes . 
a beguiling splash of pastel colors and prankish comedy from disney . 
could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence . 
what a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is . 
is it a total success ? no . is it something any true film addict will want to check out ? you bet . 
medem may have disrobed most of the cast  leaving their bodies exposed  but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt . that's why sex and lucia is so alluring . 
the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize  of course  two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie . 
this isn't exactly profound cinema  but it's good-natured and sometimes quite funny . 
  not really as bad as you might think !  
uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense  nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy  and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation . 
 . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises . 
desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
a tone of rueful compassion . . . reverberates throughout this film  whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events . 
what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world  gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share  surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we've shared a great adventure . 
the plot is very clever  but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events  all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
we can see the wheels turning  and we might resent it sometimes  but this is still a nice little picture  made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer . 
a low-budget affair  tadpole was shot on digital video  and the images often look smeary and blurry  to the point of distraction . then again  in a better movie  you might not have noticed . 
cannon's confidence and laid-back good spirits are  with the drumming routines  among the film's saving graces . 
suffers from rambling  repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video . 
for all the complications  it's all surprisingly predictable . 
fans of behan's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy . 
despite its dry wit and compassion  the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
he's the scariest guy you'll see all summer . 
it's just rather leaden and dull . 
there are moments in this account of the life of artist frida kahlo that are among cinema's finest this year . unfortunately  they're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo's life imaginable . 
beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom . 
fathers and sons  and the uneasy bonds between them  rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film . 
it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place  minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) . 
[n]o matter how much good will the actors generate  showtime eventually folds under its own thinness . 
hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette's dialogue . 
on a certain base level  blue crush delivers what it promises  just not well enough to recommend it . 
minority report is exactly what the title indicates  a report . 
well-meaning but inert . 
the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
very predictable but still entertaining
brims with passion : for words  for its eccentric  accident-prone characters  and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life . 
all in all  it's a pretty good execution of a story that's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own . 
it's a lovely  sad dance highlighted by kwan's unique directing style . 
what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
star trek was kind of terrific once  but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy . 
droll caper-comedy remake of  big deal on madonna street  that's a sly  amusing  laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate  bellini  begins to look like a  real kaputschnik .  
abderrahmane sissako's heremakono ( waiting for happiness ) is an elegiac portrait of a transit city on the west african coast struggling against foreign influences . 
secretary manages a neat trick  bundling the flowers of perversity  comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie . 
low comedy doesn't come much lower . 
might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper . 
the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin . 
an honest  sensitive story from a vietnamese point of view . 
films are made of little moments . changing lanes tries for more . it doesn't reach them  but the effort is gratefully received . 
fails to bring as much to the table . 
maryam is more timely now than ever . 
'unfaithful' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory . too bad . 
after several scenes of this tacky nonsense  you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions  especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . 
if you're like me  a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat  then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite . 
the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic  but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back . 
it makes compelling  provocative and prescient viewing . 
just another fish-out-of-water story that barely stays afloat . 
i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done . 
very much a home video  and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
like many western action films  this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing  but its heartfelt concern about north korea's recent past and south korea's future adds a much needed moral weight . 
it's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality  and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world . 
one funny popcorn flick . 
 . . . wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie  balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams . 
escapism in its purest form . 
the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 
this directorial debut from music video show-off higuchinsky is all flash . 
the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view  the film's ice cold . 
significantly better than its 2002 children's-movie competition .
like a south-of-the-border melrose place . 
any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes . 
'god help us  but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
the filmmakers lack the nerve . . . to fully exploit the script's potential for sick humor . 
although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches  the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women . 
flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat . 
the actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face . 
the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense . 
the film is hard to dismiss -- moody  thoughtful  and lit by flashes of mordant humor . 
a bizarre piece of work  with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy  rape and suspected murder
it's a very valuable film . . . 
 . . . breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters . 
both damning and damned compelling . 
although the subject matter may still be too close to recent national events  the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters . 
tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident . 
would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story  and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
a film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers . 
coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world's endangered reefs -- and it lets the pictures do the punching . 
it's hard to imagine alan arkin being better than he is in this performance . 
more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat . 
it confirms fincher's status as a film maker who artfully bends technical know-how to the service of psychological insight . 
kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers . 
the gags are often a stitch . 
10 minutes into the film you'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away .
a mostly intelligent  engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser . 
it's too self-important and plodding to be funny  and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . 
it follows the blair witch formula for an hour  in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works  and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .
sum  is jack ryan's  do-over .  give credit to everyone from robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works . especially give credit to affleck . 
if a few good men told us that we  can't handle the truth  than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we  don't care about the truth .  
ze movie starts out so funny  then she is nothing . 
this is dicaprio's best performance in anything ever  and easily the most watchable film of the year . 
as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west .

you live the mood rather than savour the story . 
a breezy blend of art  history  esoteric musings and philosophy .

a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .

i felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes .

there's no real reason to see it  and no real reason not to . 
for the first time in several years  mr . allen has surpassed himself with the magic he's spun with the hollywood empress of ms . leoni's ellie . 
contrived as this may sound  mr . rose's updating works surprisingly well . 
a historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail . 
like the original  this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen's astringent wit . 
i'd be lying if i said my ribcage didn't ache by the end of kung pow . 
more than their unique residences  home movie is about the people who live in them  who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it .

here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah .
it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script  unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass  except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .

it's a sweet  laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth . 
insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang  shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion . but the performances of pacino  williams  and swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through . 
the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence  but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . 
spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects . he just wants them to be part of the action  the wallpaper of his chosen reality . here  thankfully  they are . 
a fine effort  an interesting topic  some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps . 
feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum .

however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging  the question remains whether this should  indeed  have been presented as a theatrical release . 
it's dumb  but more importantly  it's just not scary . 
abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that  by the end  no one in the audience or the film seems to really care .
it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while  but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality
those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or  you can do something fun tonight .

what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie . 
nothing's at stake  just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away--still  the derivative nine queens is lots of fun .

the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones . 
never does  lilo & stitch  reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past  or even that of more recent successes such as  mulan  or  tarzan .

may seriously impair your ability to ever again maintain a straight face while speaking to a highway patrolman . 
it's endearing to hear madame d . refer to her husband as 'jackie' -- and he does make for excellent company  not least as a self-conscious performer . 
the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset . 
this is not chabrol's best  but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer .

it's not life-affirming ?its vulgar and mean  but i liked it . 
abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists . 
  extreme ops  exceeds expectations . good fun  good action  good acting  good dialogue  good pace  good cinematography . 
a flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds . 
a jewish ww ii doc that isn't trying simply to out-shock  out-outrage or out-depress its potential audience ! who knew . . . 
it's all stitched together with energy  intelligence and verve  enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage . 
[a] poorly executed comedy . 
the modern remake of dumas's story is long on narrative and ( too ) short on action . 
even when there are lulls  the emotions seem authentic  and the picture is so lovely toward the end . . . you almost don't notice the 129-minute running time .
there are some fairly unsettling scenes  but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer . 
 ( caine ) proves once again he hasn't lost his touch  bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film . 
this tenth feature is a big deal  indeed -- at least the third-best  and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up  nicholas meyer's star trek vi : the undiscovered country . 
an almost unbearably morbid love story . 
it's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters  including ana's father and grandfather  come down on the issue of ana's future . 
it gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions . 
just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm . 
clever but not especially compelling . 
you can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing  'this is going to be something really good . ' and it is . 
it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie�if only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch . 
the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . 
this is one of those rare docs that paints a grand picture of an era and makes the journey feel like a party . 
apart from dazzling cinematography  we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other . 
a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie  and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending . 
mandel holland's direction is uninspired  and his scripting unsurprising  but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 
makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
this is a very fine movie -- go see it . 
with a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages  this cinderella story doesn't have a single surprise up its sleeve . but it does somehow manage to get you under its spell . 
lilia's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous  but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth . 
although some viewers will not be able to stomach so much tongue-in-cheek weirdness  those who do will have found a cult favorite to enjoy for a lifetime . 
one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
while somewhat less than it might have been  the film is a good one  and you've got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out . 
halfway through the movie  the humor dwindles . it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy . 
the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need  history and presumption tangle  and sometimes destroy  blood ties . 
feels less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the escape from new york series . 
the fast runner' transports the viewer into an unusual space
it's not going to be everyone's bag of popcorn  but it definitely gives you something to chew on . 
it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years  though don't ask still finds a few chuckles . 
frenetic but not really funny . 
the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire  but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
dark  resonant  inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement . 
told in scattered fashion  the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . 
although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original  the first film's lovely flakiness is gone  replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate  tiresome ugliness  it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
without [de niro]  city by the sea would slip under the waves . he drags it back  single-handed . 
entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics  but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel . 
you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to . 
sure  i hated myself in the morning . but then again  i hate myself most mornings . i still like moonlight mile  better judgment be damned . 
does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer jeffrey dahmer boring . 
my big fat greek wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor . 
plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 
the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story  character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together . 
needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance . 
a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts  clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . 
in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 
for a movie audience  the hours doesn't connect in a neat way  but introduces characters who illuminate mysteries of sex  duty and love . 
unfortunately  the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . 
wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um  no . but here's a movie about it anyway . 
a gentle and engrossing character study . 
it establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly  and if the suspense never rises to a higher level  it is nevertheless maintained throughout . 
if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire  it probably would look a lot like this alarming production  adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles . 
the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise . 
the fight scenes are fun  but it grows tedious . 
 . . . an enjoyably frothy 'date movie' . . . 
'film aficionados cannot help but love cinema paradiso  whether the original version or new director's cut . '
neatly constructed thriller . 
the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest . 
if you dig on david mamet's mind tricks . . . rent this movie and enjoy ! 
if you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in  sweet home alabama is diverting in the manner of jeff foxworthy's stand-up act . 
confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it . 
lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely  but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout  maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension . 
this is a nicely handled affair  a film about human darkness but etched with a light ( yet unsentimental ) touch . 
an interesting story with a pertinent ( cinematically unique ) message  told fairly well and scored to perfection  i found myself struggling to put my finger on that elusive  missing thing .  
although i didn't hate this one  it's not very good either . it can be safely recommended as a video/dvd babysitter . 
unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups  not much camera movement  and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
one of those rare  exhilarating cinematic delights that gets even better in hindsight  as you mull over its every nuance in your mind . 
it's a terrible movie in every regard  and utterly painful to watch . 
so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
bleakly funny  its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves . 
initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience . 
[haynes'] homage to such films as  all that heaven allows  and  imitation of life  transcends them . simply put   far from heaven  is a masterpiece . 
simply doesn't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time . 
solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative  the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale . 
'if you are in the mood for an intelligent weepy  it can easily worm its way into your heart . '
there's no excuse for following up a delightful  well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . 
daughter from danang reveals that efforts toward closure only open new wounds . it doesn't flinch from its unsettling prognosis  namely  that the legacy of war is a kind of perpetual pain . 
walter hill's pulpy  stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity . 
an amateurish  quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video . 
ben affleck as jack ryan  tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
an empty  purposeless exercise . 
both stars manage to be funny  but  like the recent i spy  the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . 
almost gags on its own gore . 
an overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget  video-shot  debut indie effort . 
a little better than sorcerer's stone . 
spreads itself too thin  leaving these actors  as well as the members of the commune  short of profound characterizations
i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha . 
the grey zone gives voice to a story that needs to be heard in the sea of holocaust movies . . . but the film suffers from its own difficulties . 
my wife is an actress works as well as it does because [the leads] are such a companionable couple . 
nothing happens  and it happens to flat characters . 
those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give  scratch  a second look . 
in the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes  director roger kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of . . . outrageous gags .
schaeffer isn't in this film  which may be why it works as well as it does . 
collateral damage is  despite its alleged provocation post-9/11  an antique  in the end . as are its star  its attitude and its obliviousness .
es una de esas pel韈ulas de las que uno sale reconfortado  agradecido  genuinamente sorprendido . 
this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
it's young guns meets goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs . -greaseballs mob action-comedy . 
an overemphatic  would-be wacky  ultimately tedious sex farce . 
a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis . 
it will break your heart many times over . 
dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ? 
while surprisingly sincere  this average little story is adorned with some awesome action photography and surfing . 
the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment . 
an admitted egomaniac  evans is no hollywood villain  and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he'd gone the way of don simpson . 
chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 
the phone rings and a voice tells you you've got seven days left to live . then you get another phone call warning you that if the video isn't back at blockbuster before midnight  you're going to face frightening late fees . o . k .  not really .

if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 
uno de los policiales m醩 interesantes de los 鷏timos tiempos . 
though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving  the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama . 
this time out  [sade] is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful  responsible and reckless  idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested . 
dense and thoughtful and brimming with ideas that are too complex to be rapidly absorbed . 
about as enjoyable  i would imagine  as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces . . . positively dreadful . 
there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes .
a very well-made  funny and entertaining picture . 
a movie that's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts . 
if this movie leaves you cool  it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative . 
about schmidt belongs to nicholson . gone are the flamboyant mannerisms that are the trademark of several of his performances . as schmidt  nicholson walks with a slow  deliberate gait  chooses his words carefully and subdues his natural exuberance . 
a different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know . 
a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie . 
short and sweet  but also more than anything else slight� tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 
henry bean's thoughtful screenplay provides no easy answers  but offers a compelling investigation of faith versus intellect
but buying into sham truths and routine  indie  filmmaking  freundlich has made just another safe movie . it's not horrible  just horribly mediocre . 
tennessee williams by way of oprah's book club . 
what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately  it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing  sometimes all at once . 
it's a fun adventure movie for kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure . 
all the performances are top notch and  once you get through the accents  all or nothing becomes an emotional  though still positive  wrench of a sit . 
a mix of gritty realism  crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in . 
a compelling pre-wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm  moving message . 
seldahl's barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down  first by passion and then by illness . 
fontaine masterfully creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict  inextricably entwined through family history  each seeing himself in the other  neither liking what he sees . 
the bottom line  at least in my opinion  is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 
it has the ability to offend and put off everyone  but it holds you with its outrageousness . 
 . . . del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy . 
it's all gratuitous before long  as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
highly irritating at first  mr . koury's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results . 
a well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone . 
funny and touching . 
earns its laughs from stock redneck 'types' and from the many  many moments when we recognize even without the elizabethan prose  the play behind the thing . 
even with all those rough edges safely sanded down  the american insomnia is still pretty darned good . 
a tender  witty  captivating film about friendship  love  memory  trust and loyalty . 
griffiths proves she's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession .

the emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who's ever had family trauma . 
this is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 
a moving tale of love and destruction in unexpected places  unexamined lives . 
this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror . 
exhilarating but blatantly biased . 
a laughable -- or rather  unlaughable -- excuse for a film . 
it works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film's length becomes a part of its fun . 
nine queens is not only than a frighteningly capable debut and genre piece  but also a snapshot of a dangerous political situation on the verge of coming to a head . 
sean penn  you owe nicolas cage an apology . 
director lee has a true cinematic knack  but it's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly  unabashedly on its sleeve . 
dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments . 
adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of orlean's themes without being a true adaptation of her book . 
whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy  a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly  this is surely what they'd look like . 
[grant's] bumbling magic takes over the film  and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle . 
the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
there's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers . 
it has a caffeinated  sloppy brilliance  sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care  but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 
impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels  fight off various anonymous attackers  and evade elaborate surveillance technologies . 
a broadly played  lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags . 
there's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments . and yet  it still works . 
there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work  but rarely do they involve the title character herself . 
a superlative b movie -- funny  sexy  and rousing . 
the abiding impression  despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz  is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here . 
the director  with his fake backdrops and stately pacing  never settles on a consistent tone . 
it's a frightful vanity film that  no doubt  pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . 
the director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff . 
rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr .  but there isn't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative . 
not since tom cruise in risky business has an actor made such a strong impression in his underwear . 
a literate presentation that wonderfully weaves a murderous event in 1873 with murderous rage in 2002 .
it's a testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones that by movie's end  we accept the characters and the film  flaws and all . 
the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 
no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus  accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way .
lacking gravitas  macdowell is a placeholder for grief  and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . 
if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? )  or see some interesting storytelling devices  you might want to check it out  but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
no surprises . 
it's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be . but it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds . 
a very funny movie . 
however stale the material  lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out  pandering palaver is actually funny . 
without shakespeare's eloquent language  the update is dreary and sluggish . 
despite the long running time  the pace never feels slack -- there's no scene that screams  bathroom break !  
beers  who  when she's given the right lines  can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
a dreadful live-action movie . 
cacoyannis' vision is far less mature  interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts . 
watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy . it's sweet and fluffy at the time  but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied . 
if the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals  it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material . 
it might be 'easier' to watch on video at home  but that shouldn't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience . 
in the end  we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love  chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest . 
family portrait of need  neurosis and nervy negativity is a rare treat that shows the promise of digital filmmaking . 
the members manage to pronounce kok exactly as you think they might  thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible . it's very beavis and butthead  yet always seems to elicit a chuckle . 
gangster no . 1 is solid  satisfying fare for adults .
what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess . 
theological matters aside  the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
if you've the patience  there are great rewards here . 
a sensitive  moving  brilliantly constructed work . 
broomfield turns his distinctive 'blundering' style into something that could really help clear up the case . 
 . . . delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation and simplistic story . 
there are a few stabs at absurdist comedy . . . but mostly the humor is of the sweet  gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an iranian specialty . 
the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 
while obviously aimed at kids  the country bears . . . should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio . 
mr . spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned . and they succeed merrily at their noble endeavor . 
although jackson is doubtless reserving the darkest hours for the return of the king  we long for a greater sense of urgency in the here and now of the two towers . 
tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film   the sting .
the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 
drowning's too good for this sucker . 
 . . . the story  like ravel's bolero  builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with .

sexy and romantic . 
an edifying glimpse into the wit and revolutionary spirit of these performers and their era .

writer/director mark romanek spotlights the underlying caste system in america . it's a scathing portrayal . 
every moment crackles with tension  and by the end of the flick  you're on the edge of your seat . 
where this was lazy but enjoyable  a formula comedy redeemed by its stars  that is even lazier and far less enjoyable . 
though an important political documentary  this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . 
an incredibly thoughtful  deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks . 
fairy-tale formula  serves as a paper skeleton for some very good acting  dialogue  comedy  direction and especially charm . 
these are textbook lives of quiet desperation . 
an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . 
like other great documentaries . . . this goes after one truth ( the ford administration's complicity in tearing 'orphans' from their mothers ) and stumbles upon others even more compelling . 
a lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family . 
it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie  trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness . 
rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign . 
throwing caution to the wind with an invitation to the hedonist in us all  nair has constructed this motion picture in such a way that even the most cynical curmudgeon with find himself or herself smiling at one time or another . 
director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning . 
shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie  and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension . 
[t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously  and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context . 
o �timo esfor�o do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro  que  depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento  perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos s�o explicados .

when you think you've figured out bielinsky's great game  that's when you're in the most trouble : he's the con  and you're just the mark . 
vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order . 
notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour  i'm going to recommend secretary  based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal  and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-
an uninspired preachy and clich�d war film . 
enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age . 
nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film  leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . 
muddled  melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner . 
it's better suited for the history or biography channel  but there's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .

the film's most improbable feat ? it didn't go straight to video . 
the story  touching though it is  does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature  and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long .
a perverse little truffle  dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy . 
the vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy  but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination . 
for all its surface frenzy  high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view  so little to offer . 
one-of-a-kind near-masterpiece . 
serving sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time .

[it's] a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest . 
in the end  the movie bogs down in insignificance  saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .

a preposterous  prurient whodunit . 
it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .

an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary  not smart and not engaging . 
a movie of technical skill and rare depth of intellect and feeling . 
as an actress  madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles  'swept away' sinks . 
it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational  and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff . 
it cannot be enjoyed  even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick  primarily because it is dull . yes  dull . 
harmless fun .

an odd drama set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the midwest that held my interest precisely because it didn't try to . 
mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters  however  in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy  a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid .

the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line .

novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama .

unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling . 
adroit but finally a trifle flat  mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way  say  jane campion might have done  but at least it possesses some .

a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality . 
the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .
an earnest  roughshod document  it serves as a workable primer for the region's recent history  and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool .
too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped . 
handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism . 
lacks the spirit of the previous two  and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . 
a film of quiet power .

the movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life . 
if you're burnt out on it's a wonderful life marathons and bored with a christmas carol  it might just be the movie you're looking for . it depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept . 
a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here . 
the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher . 
little more than a well-mounted history lesson . 
high crimes knows the mistakes that bad movies make and is determined not to make them  and maybe that is nobility of a sort . 
the film  like jimmy's routines  could use a few good laughs . 
the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum  where viewers would be free to leave . immediately . 
more than anything else  kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre  which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again . 
barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time
none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
[a] strong piece of work .

watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death  but boyd's film offers little else of consequence .

what makes salton sea surprisingly engrossing is that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that's often handled in fast-edit  hopped-up fashion .

a film of delicate interpersonal dances . caine makes us watch as his character awakens to the notion that to be human is eventually to have to choose . it's a sight to behold . 
its message has merit and  in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack  might have made a point or two regarding life . 
there's real visual charge to the filmmaking  and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence . 
close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trash-cinema roots to be a breath of fresh air . 
a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite . it's far from a frothy piece  and the characters are complex  laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones . 
fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn .

the stupidest  most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter .
amazing ! a college story that works even without vulgarity  sex scenes  and cussing ! 
not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved  and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry  but the film conjures the magic of author j . k . rowling's books . 
harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place  but its brains are in no particular place at all .

sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .

the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than  say  ten . . . make that three minutes . 
although melodramatic and predictable  this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five filipino-americans and their frantic efforts to find love . 
it has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion . it risks seeming slow and pretentious  because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise .

it's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil' bow wow . 
the delicious trimmings卆rrive early and stay late  filling nearly every minute厀ith a lighthearted glow  some impudent snickers  and a glorious dose of humankind's liberating ability to triumph over a scrooge or two .

director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group  who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person . 
upsetting and thought-provoking  the film has an odd purity that doesn't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them . 
whether kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question  but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion . 
has none of the crackle of  fatal attraction    9 � weeks   or even  indecent proposal   and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of  lolita  .

has a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion .

they crush each other under cars  throw each other out windows  electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness . and we don't avert our eyes for a moment . 
as gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be  they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting . 
a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood's comic-book adaptations . 
not only is it hokey  manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk  but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches .

overly long and worshipful bio-doc . 
psychologically revealing .

neil burger here succeeded in . . . making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present .

this thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
it may not be history ?but then again  what if it is ? ?but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i've had in a while . 
a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term . 
amidst the action  the script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the  other side of the story .

cute  funny  heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids  lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone . 
it is parochial  accessible to a chosen few  standoffish to everyone else  and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism  with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences  that glass's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .

it's still a comic book  but maguire makes it a comic book with soul . 
if you're not the target demographic . . . this movie is one long chick-flick slog .

koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own . 
i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast  the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
oddly compelling .

a screenplay more ingeniously constructed than  memento  
contrived pastiche of caper clich�s .

it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
kept aloft largely by a comically adept ensemble .

you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery . 
ana's journey is not a stereotypical one of self-discovery  as she's already comfortable enough in her own skin to be proud of her rubenesque physique . . . 
with few respites  marshall keeps the energy humming  and his edits  unlike those in moulin rouge  are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it . 
a moving and weighty depiction of one family's attempts to heal after the death of a child . 
it's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies  and gibson  stepping in for bruce willis  is the perfect actor to take us on the trip .

there's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of birthday girl .

a sad  superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life . 
this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences . . . and it's all the stronger because of it . 
it tries too hard  and overreaches the logic of its own world . 
the story is so light and sugary that were it a macy's thanksgiving day parade balloon  extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away . 
i found myself liking the film  though in this case one man's treasure could prove to be another man's garbage . 
the lightest  most breezy movie steven spielberg has made in more than a decade . and the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him . 
a movie that both thrills the eye and  in its over-the-top way  touches the heart . 
the hook is the drama within the drama  as an unsolved murder and an unresolved moral conflict jockey for the spotlight . 
i'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . there's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease .

shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
it is a kickass  dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some . i haven't seen one in so long  no wonder i didn't recognize it at first . 
supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
as a tolerable diversion  the film suffices ; a triumph  however  it is not . 
the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
a slick  engrossing melodrama . 
the strength of the film lies in its two central performances by sven wollter as the stricken composer and viveka seldahl as his desperate violinist wife . 
the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .

the first half bursts with a goofy energy previous disney films only used for a few minutes here and there . 
ludicrous  but director carl franklin adds enough flourishes and freak-outs to make it entertaining .

j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie  although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman  but she's no working girl .

essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty . 
with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact  harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone

worth the effort to watch . 
what might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles' book does not translate well to the screen .

bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique  entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal . 
cube's charisma and chemistry compensate for corniness and cliche . 
high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery  and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff  nearly subliminally  as the old-hat province of male intrigue .

the sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in imax dimensions  as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins . 
this series should have died long ago  but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie . 
a wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung  but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily . 
if you can read the subtitles ( the opera is sung in italian ) and you like 'masterpiece theatre' type costumes  you'll enjoy this movie . 
it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck  preferably a semi . 
a competent  unpretentious entertainment destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country .

if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift  somebody unwrapped it early  took out all the good stuff  and left behind the crap ( literally ) . 
the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on b黷tner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable  irreversible flow of history .

an awfully good  achingly human picture . 
a delicious  quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by michael gondry .

jose campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor  bittersweet pathos  and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory . 
given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same  we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time  there isn't much . 
light-years ahead of paint-by-number american blockbusters like pearl harbor  at least artistically . 
filmmakers who can deftly change moods are treasures and even marvels . so  too  is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today's new delhi . 
hugely accomplished slice of hitchcockian suspense . 
a life-size reenactment of those jack chick cartoon tracts that always ended with some hippie getting tossed into the lake of fire . 
going to this movie is a little like chewing whale blubber - it's an acquired taste that takes time to enjoy  but it's worth it  even if it does take 3 hours to get through .
much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of don king  sonny miller  and michael stewart . their work is fantastic . 
at once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge . 
starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
longley has constructed a remarkably coherent  horrifically vivid snapshot of those turbulent days . 
fails in making this character understandable  in getting under her skin  in exploring motivation . . . well before the end  the film grows as dull as its characters  about whose fate it is hard to care . 
eventually arrives at its heart  as simple self-reflection meditation . 
unofficially  national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially  it is twice as bestial but half as funny . 
beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small  sweet 'evelyn . '
there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce  part sliding doors  part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them . 
two hours fly by -- opera's a pleasure when you don't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated . 
hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors  but it doesn't . 
a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
it's a big idea  but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type  more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script  which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 
a boring  pretentious muddle that uses a sensational  real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well  i'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop .
the film takes too long getting to the good stuff  then takes too long figuring out what to do next . 
all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure . 
audiard successfully maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling .

seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory . 
plays like a volatile and overlong w magazine fashion spread . 
it's a stale  overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch  it's one of the worst of the entire franchise .
its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off  with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 
it is nature against progress . in fessenden's horror trilogy  this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale . 
a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is  overall  far too staid for its subject matter . 
it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action . 
not a bad journey at all . 
a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . it's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter .

an involving true story of a chinese actor who takes up drugs and winds up in an institution--acted mostly by the actual people involved . 
the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 
 . . . perhaps the heaviest  most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers )  the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise  one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
an entertaining british hybrid of comedy  caper thrills and quirky romance . 
it's a pleasure to see seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies chris rock  garry shandling and colin quinn .

thumbs up to paxton for not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer . 
my big fat greek wedding is not only the best date movie of the year  it's also a -- dare i say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally american  i might add -- slice of comedic bliss . 
the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself  which feels  as it plods toward the end  less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable  in its committed dumbness . 
basically  it's pretty but dumb . 
a pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between xxx and vertical limit . 
moonlight mile doesn't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy . 
so beautifully acted and directed  it's clear that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses . 
ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
the movie is hardly a masterpiece  but it does mark ms . bullock's best work in some time . 
the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . 
 . . . its stupidities wind up sticking in one's mind a lot more than the cool bits . 
by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters  i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie . 
i don't mind having my heartstrings pulled  but don't treat me like a fool . 
the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air  but on the inspired performance of tim allen . 
not just unlikable . disturbing . disgusting . without any redeeming value whatsoever . 
its maker  steven spielberg  hasn't had so much fun in two decades  since he was schlepping indiana jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray . 
what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes .
funny in a sick  twisted sort of way . 
so muddled  repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
last orders nurtures the multi-layers of its characters  allowing us to remember that life's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced . it's affecting  amusing  sad and reflective . 
the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point  unless it's that life stinks  especially for sensitive married women who really love other women . 
that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions  defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . 
an effectively creepy  fear-inducing ( not fear-reducing ) film from japanese director hideo nakata  who takes the superstitious curse on chain letters and actually applies it . 
it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has . 
jones has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers . 
a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe . 
a miniscule little bleep on the film radar  but one that many more people should check out
this movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one  but it's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it . 
while this gentle and affecting melodrama will have luvvies in raptures  it's far too slight and introspective to appeal to anything wider than a niche audience . 
despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry  witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america's sweetheart . 
smart  provocative and blisteringly funny . 
a bit of an unwieldy mess . 
happily  some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude . for proof of that on the cinematic front  look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls  retrospectively  his most personal work yet .
 . . . has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they're ghosts imagining themselves as alive . it's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke  made creepy by its  men in a sardine can  warped logic . 
jir?hubac's script is a gem . his characters are engaging  intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving . the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives  full of strength  warmth and vitality . . 
heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on petter n鎠s' delicate  clever direction . . . and a wonderful  imaginative script by axel hellstenius . 
viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
you're not merely watching history  you're engulfed by it . 
i'm not a fan of the phrase 'life affirming' because it usually means 'schmaltzy  ' but real women have curves truly is life affirming . 
the heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging  suffering and the prospect of death . 
it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i can't wait for the sequel . 
cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters  its stars and its audience . 
at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated ( depending upon where you live )  ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two . 
as it turns out  you can go home again . 
a welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic  this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story . 
the experience of watching blobby old-school cgi animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting . 
chilling but uncommercial look into the mind of jeffrey dahmer  serial killer . 
deflated ending aside  there's much to recommend the film . 
the performances are immaculate  with roussillon providing comic relief . 
 . . . a visually seductive  unrepentantly trashy take on rice's second installment of her vampire chronicles . 
an entertaining  if somewhat standardized  action movie . 
the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas  which never reach satisfying conclusions . 
the bland outweighs the nifty  and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is . 
if you love motown music  you'll love this documentary . 
the master of disguise represents adam sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe . 
degenerates into hogwash . 
mildly amusing . 
helps to remind the first world that hiv/aids is far from being yesterday's news . 
while kids will probably eat the whole thing up  most adults will be way ahead of the plot . 
the perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide . 
the satire is unfocused  while the story goes nowhere . 
never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man . the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring  inventive and impressive . 
travels a fascinating arc from hope and euphoria to reality and disillusionment .

[jeff's] gorgeous  fluid compositions  underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams's melancholy music  are charged with metaphor  but rarely easy  obvious or self-indulgent . 
where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony  jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
invigorating  surreal  and resonant with a rainbow of emotion . 
ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material  showing impressive control  both visually and in the writing . 
as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars  standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative  revealing and richly entertaining . 
rambles on in a disjointed  substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next . 
while the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed  the subject matter is so fascinating that you won't care . 
contrasting the original ringu with the current americanized adaptation is akin to comparing the evil dead with evil dead ii
a smart  provocative drama that does the nearly impossible : it gets under the skin of a man we only know as an evil  monstrous lunatic . 
[johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs  but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers . 
the romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be . 
that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year's worst cinematic tragedies . 
a map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn with a master's steady stroke . 
  home movie  is a sweet treasure and something well worth your time . 
the draw [for  big bad love  ] is a solid performance by arliss howard . 
this isn't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby  it's the cliffsnotes with pages missing . 
reveals how important our special talents can be when put in service of of others . it also shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them . 
the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission . 
singer/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs ?a few potential hits  a few more simply intrusive to the story ?but the whole package certainly captures the intended  er  spirit of the piece . 
in the end  ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point  and little social context . 
neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 
an intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time . 
full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . 
faultlessly professional but finally slight . 
me no lika da accents so good  but i thoroughly enjoyed the love story . scott baio is turning in some delightful work on indie projects . 
the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago  and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches isn't exactly endearing . 
i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier  by rohmer  for example . 
allen shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today . 
  the ring  is pretty much an english-language copy of the film that inspired it  and it carries the same strengths and flaws . 
ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles  but don't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here . 
i saw knockaround guys yesterday  and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war . . . it's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink . 
the film is saved from aren't-kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that isn't faked and a stately sense of composition . 
qutting may be a flawed film  but it is nothing if not sincere . 
[it] has the feel of a summer popcorn movie . nothing too deep or substantial . explosions  jokes  and sexual innuendoes abound . 
  home movie  is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book . 
no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it . 
screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull  but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability . 
draggin' about dragons
it looks closely  insightfully at fragile  complex relationships . 
mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances  but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion  grief and fear . 
nelson's intentions are good  but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel  seth green and barry pepper . it should have stayed there . 
while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills  suspense  and gore for video games  the movie really only succeeds in the third of these . 
meticulously uncovers a trail of outrageous force and craven concealment . 
a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room  complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . 
far-fetched premise  convoluted plot  and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love . 
sillier  cuter  and shorter than the first ( as best i remember )  but still a very good time at the cinema . 
for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh  sometimes funny  and usually genuinely worthwhile  hollywood ending is a depressing experience
the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles  one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
light the candles  bring out the cake and don't fret about the calories because there's precious little substance in birthday girl -- it's simply  and surprisingly  a nice  light treat . 
worth catching for griffiths' warm and winning central performance . 
you have to pay attention to follow all the stories  but they're each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic  and one to ponder after the credits roll . 
obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic . 
it's often infuriatingly glib and posturing  and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer . 
  my god  i'm behaving like an idiot !  yes  you are  ben kingsley . 
irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free . 
the spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist . 
a deeply felt and vividly detailed story about newcomers in a strange new world . 
a film about a young man finding god that is accessible and touching to the marrow . 
based on dave barry's popular book of the same name  the movie benefits from having a real writer plot out all of the characters' moves and overlapping story . 
as spent screen series go  star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink .
oversexed  at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty  female and single . 
harris is supposed to be the star of the story  but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . 
it may . . . work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scooby-doo shows or reruns . 
sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies  but fails loudly in execution . 
a gorgeous  somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising . 
a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions . 
its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously  but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare . 
the first bond movie in ages that isn't fake fun . 
one of those unassuming films that sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theatre . 
i can't remember the last time i saw an audience laugh so much during a movie  but there's only one problem�it's supposed to be a drama . 
crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls . 
while some of the camera work is interesting  the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 
unfortunately  as a writer  mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor . 
the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down . 
there's nothing exactly wrong here  but there's not nearly enough that's right . 
 . . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and  except for the fine star performances  there is little else to recommend  never again .  
if only it were  well  funnier . 
offers laughs and insight into one of the toughest ages a kid can go through . 
while the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo . . . broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity .

how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly . 
barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality . 
a fitfully amusing romp that  if nothing else  will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star  frankie muniz . 
great story  bad idea for a movie . 
 . . . pray doesn't have a passion for the material . he nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race . 
 . . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects . 
an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 
a ragbag of cliches . 
alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors . 
the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly  wise and knowing or downright comically evil . 
inherently caustic and oddly whimsical  the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss . 
the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters . 
witty  contemplative  and sublimely beautiful . 
one of recent memory's most thoughtful films about art  ethics  and the cost of moral compromise . 
if a horror movie's primary goal is to frighten and disturb  then they works spectacularly well . . . a shiver-inducing  nerve-rattling ride . 
ararat feels like a book report
that rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama  conflict  tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film . 
tadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling  and downright creepy  subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother . 
imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs . 
some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the ball and chain . 
the story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors  whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it's as if it all happened only yesterday . 
an old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale of the kind they rarely make anymore . 
gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess  whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up . 
there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau . 
earnest but earthbound . . . a slow  soggy  soporific  visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast . 
the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand . 
de niro and mcdormand give solid performances  but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest . 
meticulously mounted  exasperatingly well-behaved film  which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 
a gripping documentary that reveals how deep the antagonism lies in war-torn jerusalem . 
did no one on the set have a sense of humor  or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? 
murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie -of-the-week films clumsily stuck together . 
the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers  and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . 
drives for the same kind of bittersweet  conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . 
kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie . and adults will at least have a dream image of the west to savor whenever the film's lamer instincts are in the saddle . 
disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids' books to the screen . . . tuck everlasting is a little of both . 
wang xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men . 
life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why . 
if you like blood  guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though . . . you will likely enjoy this monster . 
a rather brilliant little cult item : a pastiche of children's entertainment  superhero comics  and japanese animation . 
[it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones  but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy . 
ryan gosling . . . is at 22 a powerful young actor .
a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
laced with liberal doses of dark humor  gorgeous exterior photography  and a stable-full of solid performances  no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 
this is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action  cheese  ham and cheek ( as well as a serious debt to the road warrior )  but it feels like unrealized potential
what's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor . 
its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director's previous popcorn work . 
its rawness and vitality give it considerable punch . 
for most of its footage  the new thriller proves that director m . night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp  shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo . 
the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys  whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting  writing or direction . 
no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
the threat implied in the title pok�mon 4ever is terrifying � like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .
it's another video movie photographed like a film  with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism . 
a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd  the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 
the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind .
bears resemblance to  and shares the weaknesses of  too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences . 
a biopic about crane's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video . 
the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid  but when it has the temerity to run over two hours  you feel like winding up with a kick . 
beautifully crafted  engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic  twisty yarn that will keep them guessing . 
it arrives with an impeccable pedigree  mongrel pep  and almost indecipherable plot complications . 
ah  the travails of metropolitan life ! alas  another breathless movie about same ! 
though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal  i felt disrespected . 
flawed but worthy look at life in u . s . relocation camps . 
there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter . 
rodriguez does a splendid job of racial profiling hollywood style--casting excellent latin actors of all ages--a trend long overdue . 
creeps you out in high style  even if nakata did it better . 
a big fat pain . 
verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies . 
gives us a lot to chew on  but not all of it has been properly digested . 
a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times  but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 
an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it  something happens that tells you there is no sense . 
an affectionately goofy satire that's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary . . . 
most of the things that made the original men in black such a pleasure are still there . 
all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels  it should pay reparations to viewers . 
there's something poignant about an artist of 90-plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us .
twenty years later  reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery  but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task . 
the movie worked for me right up to the final scene  and then it caved in . 
hands down the year's most thought-provoking film . but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship . 
bring on the sequel . 
this version moves beyond the original's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema's inability to stand in for true  lived experience . 
 . . . a story we haven't seen on the big screen before  and it's a story that we as americans  and human beings  should know . 
slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by . 
the film is bright and flashy in all the right ways . 
a superbly acted and funny/gritty fable of the humanizing of one woman at the hands of the unseen forces of fate . 
if the full monty was a freshman fluke  lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump . 
between them  de niro and murphy make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season . 
a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
a half-assed film . 
a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
involving at times  but lapses quite casually into the absurd . 
the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun . 
the whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 
charlize chases kevin with a gun . courtney chases stuart with a cell phone . the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing . 
even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder  however  kilmer seems to be posing  rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea . 
these are lives worth watching  paths worth following . 
essentially  fatal attraction  remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier  not scarier  as it goes along . . .
there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen's men . 
charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early-'80s suburbia  it's significant without being overstated .
so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
it's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman . 
a captivating and intimate study about dying and loving . . . 
in its dry and forceful way  it delivers the same message as jiri menzel's closely watched trains and danis tanovic's no man's land . 
the movie is full of fine performances  led by josef bierbichler as brecht and monica bleibtreu as helene weigel  his wife . 
stands as a document of what it felt like to be a new yorker -- or  really  to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 .
as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum  not even ms . redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality . 
a thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses grant's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos . 
. . . familiar and predictable  and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor .
 . . . for all its social and political potential  state property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful . 
a era do gelo diverte  mas n�o convence . � um passatempo descompromissado � e s� . 
if you're in the mood for a bollywood film  here's one for you . 
unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters  the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor  ethnic slurs . 
while not quite a comedy  the film tackles its relatively serious subject with an open mind and considerable good cheer  and is never less than engaging . 
gently humorous and touching . 
a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking . 
the limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie . 
beautiful  cold  oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly  a freaky bit of art that's there to scare while we delight in the images . 
this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating  albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border . 
a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about . 
  what really happened ?  is a question for philosophers  not filmmakers ; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience . 
when the plot kicks in  the film loses credibility . 
an unflinching  complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen . 
a distinguished and thoughtful film  marked by acute writing and a host of splendid performances . 
no  it's not as single-minded as john carpenter's original  but it's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels . 
caviezel embodies the transformation of his character completely . 
scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario . 
a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director  tom dey  had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and  for that matter  shrek ) .
 . . . too sappy for its own good . 
a savage john waters-like humor that dances on the edge of tastelessness without ever quite falling over . 
amari has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances . 
this breezy caper movie becomes a soulful  incisive meditation on the way we were  and the way we are . 
the filmmakers wisely decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best  and fashion a story around him . 
harsh  effective documentary on life in the israeli-occupied palestinian territories . 
  red dragon  is entertaining . an obvious copy of one of the best films ever made  how could it not be ? but it is entertaining on an inferior level . it is a popcorn film  not a must-own  or even a must-see . 
sweet gentle jesus  did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ? 
this is a movie that starts out like heathers  then becomes bring it on  then becomes unwatchable . 
has its moments  but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life's messiness from inside out  in all its strange quirks . 
though harris is affecting at times  he cannot overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities . 
a real story about real people living their lives concerned about the future of an elderly  mentally handicapped family member . 
in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter  silberling also  to a certain extent  trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
the film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers . 
the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
the quiet american isn't a bad film  it's just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar . 
you can see where big bad love is trying to go  but it never quite gets there . 
there is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country . 
storytelling feels slight . 
an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment . 
australian actor/director john polson and award-winning english cinematographer giles nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation . 
this story still seems timely and important . and there's an element of heartbreak to watching it now  with older and wiser eyes  because we know what will happen after greene's story ends . 
the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion . 
calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . 
an enjoyable film for the family  amusing and cute for both adults and kids . 
a very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage . 
a thriller whose style  structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story  you cannot separate them . 
it's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of anna chancellor that makes this  two weddings and a funeral  fun . 
the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher  played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life . 
uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics  a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things . 
payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey  featuring a pathetic  endearing hero who is all too human . 
even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many  although in reality they are not enough . every child's story is what matters . this film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost . 
the film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor  as cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin . 
if this disposable tissue has one wild card  it's john turturro  who's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish . 
if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was  i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately  you still have that option . 
anyway  for one reason or another  crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that  it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad  but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances  it's not a total loss . 
cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese  indeed . 
tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
melodrama with a message . 
i believe silberling had the best intentions here  but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them . 
rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre  who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski  made richer by his own experiences  making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain . 
wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating  so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .
one can't deny its seriousness and quality . 
this is wild surreal stuff  but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other . 
a grimly competent and stolid and earnest military courtroom drama . 
otto-sallies has a real filmmaker's eye . 
perhaps the best sports movie i've ever seen . 
to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns  you have to gloss over the no sense ending . 
the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits  headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work . 
campbell scott finds the ideal outlet for his flick-knife diction in the role of roger swanson . 
what's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy . 
harvard man is a semi-throwback  a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality . 
pull[s] off the rare trick of recreating not only the look of a certain era  but also the feel . 
pray's film works well and will appeal even to those who aren't too familiar with turntablism . 
the problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving  and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy  pretty and gifted  it really won my heart . 
provide[s] nail-biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology-of-the-moment technique or pretentious dialogue . 
a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) . 
i can imagine this movie as a b&w british comedy  circa 1960  with peter sellers  kenneth williams  et al .  but at this time  with this cast  this movie is hopeless .
waiting for godard can be fruitful : 'in praise of love' is the director's epitaph for himself . 
the film may appear naked in its narrative form . . . but it goes deeper than that  to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the catholic doctrine
fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense . 
a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial . 
a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship . 
secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny . 
lyne's latest  the erotic thriller unfaithful  further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . 
the essential problem in orange county is that  having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast  the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do . 
engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship . 
the cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed . 
this odd  distant portuguese import more or less borrows from bad lieutenant and les vampires  and comes up with a kind of art-house gay porn film . 
the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming  but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
parts seem like they were lifted from terry gilliam's subconscious  pressed through kafka's meat grinder and into bu駏el's casings
this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece  in treading the line between sappy and sanguine  winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
a muddled limp biscuit of a movie  a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms .

the plot grows thin soon  and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution . 
a woefully dull  redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation  despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
the film's messages of tolerance and diversity aren't particularly original  but one can't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters .

skip this dreck  rent animal house and go back to the source . 
nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows . 
cinematic poo .

whenever you think you've figured out late marriage  it throws you for a loop . 
as an introduction to the man's theories and influence  derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man  however  it's invaluable . 
a glorious mess . 
even if you don't understand what on earth is going on  this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion  if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why . 
i know we're not supposed to take it seriously  but i can't shake the thought that undercover brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary . 
its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper . 
it's an odd show  pregnant with moods  stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 
[seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
people cinema at its finest . 
it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes . 
it rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide . 
the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) . 
often demented in a good way  but it is an uneven film for the most part . 
an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
new ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is . 
passionate  irrational  long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula  helga figures prominently in this movie  and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats .

the bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand  and they've told a nice little story in the process . 
[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein  and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought  the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract . 
naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work  on the other hand  may fall fast asleep . 
cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility . 
just how these families interact may surprise you . 
tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme doesn't drag an audience down . 
the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered . 
lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i couldn't help being captivated by it . 
sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
at its best when the guarded  resentful betty and the manipulative yet needy margot are front and center . 
a bittersweet film  simple in form but rich with human events . 
much of the lady and the duke is about quiet  decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . 
every visual joke is milked  every set-up obvious and lengthy  every punchline predictable . there's no energy . 
an inventive  absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist . 
there has been much puzzlement among critics about what the election symbolizes . i believe the message is in the messenger : the agent is a woman .

a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through .

the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality  but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious . 
while it's nothing we haven't seen before from murphy  i spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it's more than a worthwhile effort .

since lee is a sentimentalist  the film is more worshipful than your random e ! true hollywood story . 
until ( the ) superfluous . . . epilogue that leaks suspension of disbelief like a sieve  die another day is as stimulating & heart-rate-raising as any james bond thriller . 
an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
it could have been something special  but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms  and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress . 
the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision  any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . 
this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter .
as a first-time director  paxton has tapped something in himself as an actor that provides frailty with its dark soul . 
humorless  self-conscious art drivel  made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
the script  the gags  the characters are all direct-to-video stuff  and that's where this film should have remained . 
for all its visual panache and compelling supporting characters  the heart of the film rests in the relationship between sullivan and his son . 
the film is delicately narrated by martin landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by dana janklowicz-mann . 
though catch me if you can isn't badly made  the fun slowly leaks out of the movie . 
a dull  somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 
silly stuff  all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another . 
the ingenuity that parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of wilde himself .

pretty good little movie . 
the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest  but its just not a thrilling movie .

the film might have been more satisfying if it had  in fact  been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .

a movie that can't get sufficient distance from leroy's delusions to escape their maudlin influence .

as it stands it's an opera movie for the buffs . 
thoughtless  random  superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents
the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy  but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can  given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
the whole thing feels like a ruse  a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or  worse yet  nonexistent -- ideas . 
depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply .

a live-action cartoon  a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind .
a journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history  in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick  and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect  love-hate relationship . 
cold and scattered  minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that  finally  is minimally satisfying . 
while the film misfires at every level  the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . 
even though we know the outcome  the seesawing of the general's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller  while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy . 
there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . 
pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws .
return to never land may be another shameless attempt by disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families  but it's not half-bad .

in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little . 
returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters  sandler  who also executive produces  has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy . 
the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived  overblown and tie-in ready . 
the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor  but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 
overall  cletis tout is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone .

richard gere and diane lane put in fine performances as does french actor oliver martinez . 
while not for every taste  this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise  too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy . 
comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief . 
as the sulking  moody male hustler in the title role  [franco] has all of dean's mannerisms and self-indulgence  but none of his sweetness and vulnerability . 
[gai] comes closer to any actress i can remember to personifying independence in its purest and  yes  most intimidating form . 
standing in the shadows of motown is the best kind of documentary  one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow . 
while it's all quite tasteful to look at  the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
as antonia is assimilated into this newfangled community  the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure  daytime-drama sort of fashion . 
the whole thing's fairly lame  making it par for the course for disney sequels . 
while we no longer possess the lack-of-attention span that we did at seventeen  we had no trouble sitting for blade ii . 
it leers  offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . 
an 83 minute document of a project which started in a muddle  seesawed back and forth between controlling interests multiple times  then found its sweet spot
a solid  psychological action film from hong kong . 
exciting and well-paced . 
audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .
even on its own ludicrous terms  the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum  and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 
stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros . -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end  along with green's half-hearted movie career . 
almost everything about the film is unsettling  from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 
 . . . this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels . 
cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression .
except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain  the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 
[creates] the worst kind of mythologizing  the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 
if you're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining  you're in luck . 
[reaches] wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair . 
there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here  but who the hell cares ? 
it gives devastating testimony to both people's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good . 
an achingly enthralling premise  the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses . 
a gripping movie  played with performances that are all understated and touching . 
blade ii is as estrogen-free as movies get  so you might want to leave your date behind for this one  or she's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time . 
 . . . by the time it's done with us  mira nair's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery  of having been immersed in a foreign culture only to find that human nature is pretty much the same all over . 
polished  well-structured film . 
a weird and wonderful comedy . 
a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores . 
a sterling film - a cross between boys don't cry  deliverance  and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard  but that film is yet to be made . 
waydowntown may not be an important movie  or even a good one  but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway . 
[d]oesn't bother being as cloying or preachy as equivalent evangelical christian movies -- maybe the filmmakers know that the likely audience will already be among the faithful . 
its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters  but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 
i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather  you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
the concept is a hoot . the trailer is a riot . the movie is a dud . 
an impossible romance  but we root for the patronized iranian lad . 
there's little to recommend snow dogs  unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
the ring is worth a look  if you don't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your halloween entertainment . 
it's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown chelsea hotel . . . 
offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie  largely devoid of charm . 
westfeldt and juergensen exude a chemistry and comfort level that's both saucy and endearing . 
a confluence of kiddie entertainment  sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design . 
the pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers occupied amidst some of the more serious-minded concerns of other year-end movies . 
the film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both steve buscemi and rosario dawson . . . 
it moves quickly  adroitly  and without fuss ; it doesn't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the cold war datedness -- of its premise . 
the drama discloses almost nothing . 
you're better off staying home and watching the x-files . 
the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they won't much care about . 
largely  this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . 
a mature  deeply felt fantasy of a director's travel through 300 years of russian history .
though it's become almost redundant to say so  major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working-class . 
and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> . 
trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible . 
the path ice age follows most closely  though  is the one established by warner bros . giant chuck jones  who died a matter of weeks before the movie's release . 
the movie is brilliant  really . it is philosophy  illustrated through everyday events . 
you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
 . . . the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning . 
the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension . 
irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . there are far worse messages to teach a young audience  which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy . 
pascale bailly's rom-com provides am�lie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i . e .  a banal spiritual quest . 
one of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society . 
richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material  but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold . 
what you expect is just what you get . . . assuming the bar of expectations hasn't been raised above sixth-grade height . 
this road movie gives you emotional whiplash  and you'll be glad you went along for the ride . 
a moving picture that does not move . 
tres greek writer and star nia vardalos has crafted here a worldly-wise and very funny script . 
 . . . hits every cliche we've come to expect  including the assumption that  crazy  people are innocent  childlike and inherently funny . 
while the material is slight  the movie is better than you might think . 
spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
compassionately explores the seemingly irreconcilable situation between conservative christian parents and their estranged gay and lesbian children . 
stage director sam mendes showcases tom hanks as a depression era hit-man in this dark tale of revenge . 
eric byler's nuanced pic avoids easy sentiments and explanations . . . 
an exquisitely crafted and acted tale . 
overall  interesting as a documentary -- but not very imaxy . 
[denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product .
a droll  well-acted  character-driven comedy with unexpected deposits of feeling . 
it's fun  splashy and entertainingly nasty . 
it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color . 
an intelligent  multi-layered and profoundly humanist ( not to mention gently political ) meditation on the values of knowledge  education  and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement . 
biggie and tupac is so single-mindedly daring  it puts far more polished documentaries to shame . 
a rather tired exercise in nostalgia . 
doesn't really add up to much . 
a complete waste of time . 
an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie . 
we are left with a superficial snapshot that  however engaging  is insufficiently enlightening and inviting . 
while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang  etc . )  the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences . 
a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido . 
provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of todd solondz . 
mildly entertaining . 
this gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family . 
the movie is loaded with good intentions  but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story  minac drains his movie of all individuality . 
it's push-the-limits teen comedy  the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny  and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed . 
a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal . 
a taut  intelligent psychological drama . 
[sam's] self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining . 
directors john musker and ron clements  the team behind the little mermaid  have produced sparkling retina candy  but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space . 
the continued good chemistry between carmen and juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going  with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained . 
i would be shocked if there was actually one correct interpretation  but that shouldn't make the movie or the discussion any less enjoyable . 
they should have called it gutterball . 
the message of such reflections--intentional or not--is that while no art grows from a vacuum  many artists exist in one . 
the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving  well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan  thinly sketched story . killing time  that's all that's going on here . 
this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .
uneven but a lot of fun . 
the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
brilliantly explores the conflict between following one's heart and following the demands of tradition . 
ill-considered  unholy hokum . 
more intellectually scary than dramatically involving . 
compelling as it is exotic  fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue  treachery and murder . 
a thought-provoking picture . 
the story and structure are well-honed . fresnadillo's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that won't go away . 
mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags  scattered moments of lazy humor . 
the reason to see  sade  lay with the chemistry and complex relationship between the marquis ( auteil ) and emilie ( le besco ) . 
delirious fun . 
'carente de imaginaci�n  mal dirigida  peor actuada y sin un �pice de romance  es una verdadera p�rdida de tiempo y dinero'
there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant . 
 . . . hopefully it'll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around . wait to see it then . 
the film is all over the place  really . it dabbles all around  never gaining much momentum . 
  i blame all men for war   [the warden's daughter] tells her father . the movie is about as deep as that sentiment . 
'si bien no logra desarrollarse como un gran drama  tampoco es tan superficial como muchas cintas que pecan de pretenciosas y que resultan totalmente banales . '
the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid . 
showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . 
all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
the filmmakers try to balance pointed  often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness  with results that are sometimes bracing  sometimes baffling and quite often  and in unexpected ways  touching . 
it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly  yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling  shamelessly manipulative and contrived  and totally lacking in conviction . 
most impressive  though  is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters' emotional wounds . 
any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race  you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it . 
like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter . 
the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d .
yes  spirited away is a triumph of imagination  but it's also a failure of storytelling . 
at its best ( and it does have some very funny sequences ) looking for leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be . 
like schindler's list  the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent  but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting  shooting or post-production stages . 
a moving  if uneven  success . 
this is carion's debut feature but his script and direction hums with a confidence that many spend entire careers trying to reach . 
visits spy-movie territory like a novel you can't put down  examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen  and keeps you guessing from first frame to last . 
a backstage must-see for true fans of comedy . 
it's a fine  old-fashioned-movie movie  which is to say it's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance . 
nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy .
watching the chemistry between freeman and judd  however  almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost . 
maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages  but something aboul  full frontal  seems  well  contrived . 
a fascinating  unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man . 
cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out  and at other times outside looking in . 
these people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance . 
this is human comedy at its most amusing  interesting and confirming . 
dragonfly has no atmosphere  no tension -- nothing but costner  flailing away . it's a buggy drag . 
the charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film's problems . 
it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves  without all oedekerk's impish augmentation . 
jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness . 
 . . . a cheap  ludicrous attempt at serious horror . 
feels like pieces a bunch of other  better movies slapped together . 
a film that will enthrall the whole family . 
a photographic marvel of sorts  and it's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community . 
goes a long way on hedonistic gusto . 
one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature . 
earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock . 
more mature than fatal attraction  more complete than indecent proposal and more relevant than 9 ?weeks  unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema .
director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle  endearing 1975 children's novel .
this filmed tosca -- not the first  by the way -- is a pretty good job  if it's filmed tosca that you want . i'll stay with the stage versions  however  which bite cleaner  and deeper . 
a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff .
